They also depend on the size of your setup and the software stack you select. Before purchasing hardware or installing a database version, it's essential to consult the Zabbix documentation for the most up-to-date requirements for the version you plan to install. You can find the latest requirements https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/installation/requirements. Make sure to select the correct Zabbix version from the list.</p> <p>For smaller or test setups, Zabbix can comfortably run on a system with 2 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM. However, your setup size, the number of items you monitor, the triggers you create, and how long you plan to retain data will impact resource requirements. In today's virtualised environments, my advice is to start small and scale up as needed.</p> <p>You can install all components (Zabbix server, database, web server) on a single machine or distribute them across multiple servers. For simplicity, take note of the server details:</p> Component IP Address Zabbix Server Database Server Web Server Tip <p>Zabbix package names often use dashes (<code>-</code>) in their names, such as <code>zabbix-get</code> or <code>zabbix-sender</code>, but the binaries themselves may use underscores (<code>_</code>), like <code>zabbix_sender</code> or <code>zabbix_server</code>. This naming discrepancy can sometimes be confusing, particularly if you are using packages from non-official Zabbix repositories.</p> <p>Always check if a binary uses a dash or an underscore when troubleshooting.</p> Warning <p>Starting from Zabbix 7.2, only MySQL (including its forks) and PostgreSQL are supported as back-end databases.

A firewall is a crucial security component that helps protect your server from unauthorized access and potential threats by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</p> <p>To install and enable the firewall, run the following command:</p> <p>Install and enable the firewall</p> <p>Red Hat <pre><code>dnf install firewalld\nsystemctl enable firewalld --now\n</code></pre> SUSE <pre><code>zypper install firewalld\nsystemctl enable firewalld --now\n</code></pre></p> <p>Ubuntu <pre><code>sudo apt install ufw\nsudo ufw enable\n</code></pre></p> What is firewalld / ufw <p>Firewalld is the replacement for iptables in RHEL- and SUSE-based systems and allows changes to take effect immediately without needing to restart the service. If your distribution does not use Firewalld, refer to your OS documentation for the appropriate firewall configuration steps. Ubuntu makes use of UFW which is merely a frontend for iptables.</p> <p>During the Zabbix installation in the next chapters, we will need to open specific ports in the firewall to allow communication between Zabbix components.</p> <p>Alternatively to just opening ports, as we will do in the next chapters, you can also choose to define dedicated firewall zones for specific use cases. This  approach enhances security by isolating services and restricting access based on trust levels. For example...</p> <p>Create a firewalld zone for database access</p> <pre><code>firewall-cmd --new-zone=db_zone --permanent\n</code></pre> <p>You can confirm the creation of the zone by executing the following command:</p> <p>Verify the zone creation</p> <pre><code>localhost:~ # firewall-cmd --get-zones\nblock dmz drop external home internal nm-shared db_zone public trusted work\n</code></pre> <p>Using zones in firewalld to configure firewall rules provides several advantages in terms of security, flexibility, and ease of management. Here\u2019s why zones are beneficial:</p> <ul> <li>Granular Access Control :</li> </ul> Firewalld zones allow different levels of trust for different network interfaces and IP ranges. You can define which systems are allowed to connect to PostgreSQL based on their trust level. <ul> <li>Simplified Rule management:</li> </ul> Instead of manually defining complex iptables rules, zones provide an organized way to group and manage firewall rules based on usage scenarios. <ul> <li>Enhanced security:</li> </ul> By restricting application access to a specific zone, you prevent unauthorized connections from other interfaces or networks. <ul> <li>Dynamic configuration:</li> </ul> Firewalld supports runtime and permanent rule configurations, allowing changes without disrupting existing connections. <ul> <li>Multi-Interface support:</li> </ul> If the server has multiple network interfaces, zones allow different security policies for each interface. <p>Bringing everything together to add a zone for, in this example, PostgreSQL it would look like this:</p> <p>Firewalld with zone config for PostgreSQL database access</p> <pre><code>firewall-cmd --new-zone=db_zone --permanent\nfirewall-cmd --zone=db_zone --add-service=postgresql --permanent\nfirewall-cmd --zone=db_zone --add-source=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/32 --permanent\nfirewall-cmd --reload\n</code></pre> <p>Where the <code>source IP</code> is the only address permitted to establish a connection to the database.</p> <p>If you wish to use zones when using firewalld, ensure to adapt the instructions in the following chapters accordingly.</p>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"ch00-getting-started/Requirements/#time-server","title":"Time Server","text":"<p>Another crucial step is configuring the time server and syncing the Zabbix server using an NTP client.

There are many different ways to setup a Zabbix server. We will cover the most common setups with MariaDB and PostgreSQL on RHEL- and SLES-based distro's and Ubuntu.</p> <p>Before beginning the installation, it is important to understand the architecture of Zabbix. The Zabbix server is structured in a modular fashion, composed of three main components, which we will discuss in detail.</p> <ul> <li>The Zabbix server</li> <li>The Zabbix web server</li> <li>The Zabbix database</li> </ul> <p>Creation of DB users</p> <p>In our setup we will create 2 DB users <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>. The  zabbix-web user will be used for the frontend to connect to our zabbix database. The zabbix-srv user will be used by our zabbix server to connect to the database. This allows us to limit the permissions for every user to only what is strictly needed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.1 Zabbix basic split installation</p> <p>All of these components can either be installed on a single server or distributed across three separate servers. The core of the system is the Zabbix server, often referred to as the \"brain.\" This component is responsible for processing trigger calculations and sending alerts. The database serves as the storage for the Zabbix server's configuration and all the data it collects. The web server provides the user interface (front-end) for interacting with the system. It is important to note that the Zabbix API is part of the front-end component, not the Zabbix server itself.</p> <p>These components must function together seamlessly, as illustrated in the diagram above. The Zabbix server must read configurations and store monitoring data in the database, while the front-end needs access to read and write configuration data.

Zabbix supports several database options: MySQL/Percona, MariaDB,  PostgreSQL (including TimescaleDB), and Oracle (up to Zabbix 7.0).</p> Oracle Database deprecation <p>Zabbix 7.0 marks the final release to offer support for Oracle Database. Consequently, systems running Zabbix 7.0 or any prior version must undertake a database migration to either PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a compatible fork such as MariaDB before upgrading to a later Zabbix release. This migration is a mandatory step to ensure continued functionality and compatibility with future Zabbix versions.</p> <p>All supported databases perform similarly under typical Zabbix workloads, and  Zabbix treats them equally in terms of functionality. As such, the choice  primarily depends on your or your team\u2019s familiarity with a particular database system.  One notable exception is TimescaleDB, a PostgreSQL extension optimized for  time-series data. This makes it especially well-suited for monitoring applications  like Zabbix, which handle large volumes of timestamped data.</p> <p>In large-scale environments with high-frequency data collection, TimescaleDB can deliver significant performance benefits, including improved query speeds and built-in compression to reduce storage requirements.

To administer the database, you will need to execute commands as the <code>postgres</code> user.</p> <p>First, create the Zabbix server database user (also referred to as a \"role\" in PostgreSQL):</p> <p>Create server users</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt zabbix-srv\nEnter password for new role: &lt;server-password&gt;\nEnter it again: &lt;server-password&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Next, create the Zabbix frontend user, which will be used to connect to the database:</p> <p>Create front-end user</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt zabbix-web\nEnter password for new role: &lt;frontend-password&gt;\nEnter it again: &lt;frontend-password&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now with the users created, the next step is to create the Zabbix database. Execute the following command to create the database <code>zabbix</code> with the owner set to  <code>zabbix-srv</code> and the character encoding set to <code>Unicode</code> as required by Zabbix:</p> <p>Create DB</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createdb -E Unicode -T template0 -O zabbix-srv zabbix\n</code></pre> What is this 'template0'? <p>In PostgreSQL, <code>template0</code> is a default database template that serves as a pristine copy of the database system. When creating a new database using <code>template0</code>, it ensures that the new database starts with a clean slate, without any pre-existing objects or configurations that might be present in other templates. This is particularly useful when you want to create a database with specific settings or extensions without inheriting any unwanted elements from other templates.</p> <p>Once the database is created, you should verify the connection and ensure that the correct user session is active. To do this, log into the zabbix database using the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Login as user zabbix-srv</p> <pre><code>psql -d zabbix -U zabbix-srv\n</code></pre> <p>After logging in, run the following SQL query to confirm that both the <code>session_user</code> and <code>current_user</code> are set to <code>zabbix-srv</code>:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SELECT session_user, current_user;\n session_user | current_user\n--------------+--------------\n zabbix-srv   | zabbix-srv\n(1 row)\n</code></pre> <p>If the output matches, you are successfully connected to the database with the correct user.</p> <p>PostgreSQL differs significantly from MySQL or MariaDB in several aspects, and one of the key features that sets it apart is its use of schemas. Unlike MySQL, where databases are more standalone, PostgreSQL's schema system provides a structured, multi-user environment within a single database.</p> <p>Schemas act as logical containers within a database, enabling multiple users or applications to access and manage data independently without conflicts. This feature is especially valuable in environments where several users or applications need to interact with the same database server concurrently. Each user or application can have its own schema, preventing accidental interference with each other's data.</p> Note <p>PostgreSQL comes with a default schema, typically called <code>public</code>, but in general, it's a best practice to create custom schemas to better organize and separate database objects, especially in complex or multi-user environments.</p> <p>For more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the detailed guide at this URI, https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-schema/#schema which explains the benefits and use cases for schemas in PostgreSQL.</p> <p>To finalize the initial database setup for Zabbix, we need to configure schema permissions for both the <code>zabbix-srv</code> and <code>zabbix-web</code> users.</p> <p>First, we create a custom schema named <code>zabbix_server</code> and assign ownership to the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Create the db schema</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; CREATE SCHEMA zabbix_server AUTHORIZATION \"zabbix-srv\";\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we set the <code>search path</code> to <code>zabbix_server</code> schema so that it's the default for the current session:</p> <p>Set search path</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SET search_path TO \"zabbix_server\";\n</code></pre> Tip <p>If you prefer not to set the search path manually each time you log in as the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user, you can configure PostgreSQL to automatically use the desired search path. Run the following SQL command to set the default search path for the <code>zabbix-srv</code> role:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; ALTER ROLE \"zabbix-srv\" SET search_path = zabbix_server;\n</code></pre> <p>This command ensures that every time the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user connects to the database, the <code>search_path</code> is automatically set to <code>zabbix_server</code>.</p> <p>To confirm the schema setup, you can list the existing schemas:</p> <p>Verify schema access</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\dn\n          List of schemas\n     Name      |       Owner\n---------------+-------------------\n public        | pg_database_owner\n zabbix_server | zabbix-srv\n(2 rows)\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user has full access to the schema, but the <code>zabbix-web</code> user still needs appropriate permissions to connect and interact with the database. First, we grant <code>USAGE</code> privileges on the schema to allow <code>zabbix-web</code> to connect:</p> <p>Grant access to schema for user zabbix-web</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA zabbix_server TO \"zabbix-web\";\n</code></pre> <p>Now, the <code>zabbix-web</code> user has appropriate access to interact with the schema while maintaining security by limiting permissions to essential operations.</p> <p>If you are ready you can exit the database and return to your linux shell.</p> <p>Exit the database shell</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\q\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, your Zabbix database is ready, but before it can actually be used by Zabbix, we still need to populate the database with the necessary tables and initial data, but that will be covered in the next section when we install the Zabbix server.</p> <p>If you intent to install Zabbix server on a different machine than the one hosting the database you will need to open the host firewall to allow incoming connections to the database server.

By default PHP-FPM is not allowed by SELinux on SUSE to  - map exec memory required for PHP JIT compilation, - connect to Zabbix server or - connect to the database server over TCP. We need to tell SELinux to allow all this:</p> <p>SELinux: Allow PHP-FPM to map exec memory</p> <pre><code>setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1\n</code></pre> Tip <p>To troubleshoot SELinux issues, it is recommended to install the <code>setroubleshoot</code> package which will log any SELinux denials in the system log and provide suggestions on how to resolve them.</p> <p>Depending on your Linux distribution defaults, PHP-FPM may by default not be  allowed by SystemD to write to the <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> directory required for the Zabbix frontend setup. To enable this we need to create a drop-in file to allow this:</p> <p>SystemD: Allow PHP-FPM to write to /etc/zabbix/web</p> <pre><code>systemctl edit php-fpm\n</code></pre> <p>This will open an editor to create a drop-in file <code>/etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d/override.conf</code> which will override or extend the existing service file.</p> <p>Add the following lines to the file:</p> <pre><code>[Service]\nReadWritePaths=/etc/zabbix/web\n</code></pre> <p>Then exit the editor and reload the SystemD configuration:</p> <pre><code>systemctl daemon-reload\n</code></pre> How is SystemD preventing PHP-FPM from writing to /etc/zabbix/web? <p>On many modern Linux distributions, SystemD employs a security feature known as sandboxing to restrict the capabilities of services. This is done to enhance security by limiting the access of services to only the resources they need to function. By default, PHP-FPM may be restricted from writing to certain directories, including <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code>, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. This is enforced through SystemD's <code>ProtectSystem</code> and <code>ReadWritePaths</code> directives, which control the file system access of services.</p> Tip <p>Normally write access to <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> is only needed during the initial setup of the Zabbix frontend. After the setup is complete you can remove the drop-in file again to further harden the security of your system.</p> <p>First thing we have to do is alter the Nginx configuration file so that we don't use the standard config and serve the Zabbix frontend on port 80.</p> <p>Edit nginx config for Red Hat</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n</code></pre> <p>In this configuration file look for the following block that starts with <code>server {</code>:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> Tip <p>This block may be different depending on your distribution and Nginx version.</p> <p>Then, comment out the any <code>listen</code> and <code>server_name</code> directives to disable the default http server configuration. You can do this by adding a <code>#</code> at the beginning of each line, like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n    #listen 80;\n    #listen [::]:80;\n    #server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The Zabbix configuration file must now be modified to take over the default  service on port 80 we just disabled. Open the following file for editing:</p> <p>Edit Zabbix config for nginx</p> <pre><code>sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/zabbix.conf\n</code></pre> <p>And alter the following lines:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n#       listen          8080;\n#       server_name     example.com;\n\n        root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n        index   index.php;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Remove the <code>#</code> in front of the first 2 lines and modify them with the correct  port and domain for your front-end. </p> Tip <p>In case you don't have a domain you can replace <code>servername</code> with <code>_</code>  like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after the edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n        listen          80;\n        server_name     _;\n\n         root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n         index   index.php;\n</code></pre> <p>The web server and PHP-FPM service are now ready for activation and persistent startup.

Use port 3306 for MariaDB/MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database Name</code>: Specify the name of your database. In our case, it    is zabbix. If you are using PostgreSQL, you will also need to provide the schema    name, which is zabbix_server in our case.</li> <li><code>Enther the Database Schema</code>: Only for PostgreSQL users, enter the schema name    created for Zabbix server, which is <code>zabbix_server</code> in our case.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database User</code>: Input the database user created for the web front-end,    remember in our basic installation guide we created 2 users <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>.    One for the frontend and the other one for our zabbix server so here we will use     the user <code>zabbix-web</code>. Enter the corresponding password for this user.</li> </ol> <p>Ensure that the <code>Database TLS encryption</code> option is not selected, and then click <code>Next step</code> to proceed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.8 Zabbix connections</p> <p>You're almost finished with the setup! The final steps involve:</p> <ol> <li><code>Assigning an Instance Name</code>: Choose a descriptive name for your Zabbix instance.</li> <li><code>Selecting the Timezone</code>: Choose the timezone that matches your location or     your preferred time zone for the Zabbix interface.</li> <li><code>Setting the Default Time Format</code>: Select the default time format you prefer to use.</li> <li>Encrypt connections from Web interface: I marked this box but you should    not. This box is to encrypt communications between Zabbix frontend and your    browser. We will cover this later.    Once these settings are configured, you can complete the setup and proceed with any final configuration steps as needed.</li> </ol> Note <p>It's a good practice to set your Zabbix server to the UTC timezone, especially when managing systems across multiple timezones. Using UTC helps ensure consistency in time-sensitive actions and events, as the server\u2019s timezone is often used for calculating and displaying time-related information.</p> <p></p> <p>1.9 Zabbix summary</p> <p>After clicking <code>Next step</code> again, you'll be taken to a page confirming that the configuration was successful.

This requires modifying the Zabbix server configuration file.</p> <p>The Zabbix server configuration file offers an option to include additional configuration files for custom parameters. For a production environment, it's often best to avoid altering the original configuration file directly. Instead, you can create and include separate configuration files for any additional or modified parameters. This approach ensures that your original configuration file remains untouched, which is particularly useful when performing upgrades or managing configurations with tools like Ansible, Puppet, or SaltStack.</p> <p>On SUSE 16 and later, this feature is already enabled and configured by default. (see also SUSE documentation). Hence, on SUSE systems, the Zabbix server configuration file is located at <code>/usr/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf</code>, and it is set up to include all <code>.conf</code> files from the <code>/etc/zabbix_server/zabbix_server.d/</code> directory.</p> <p>On other distributions, you may need to enable it manually:</p> <p>To enable this feature, ensure the next line exists and is not commented  (with a <code>#</code> in front of it) in <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf</code>:</p> <pre><code># Include=/usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf.d/*.conf\nInclude=/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/*.conf\n</code></pre> <p>The path <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/</code> should already be created by the installed package, but ensure it really exists.</p> <p>Now we will create a custom configuration file <code>database.conf</code> in the <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/</code> directory that will hold our database connection settings:</p> <p>Add Zabbix database connection settings</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/database.conf\n</code></pre> <p>Add the following lines in the configuration file to match your database setup:</p> <pre><code># Zabbix database configuration\nDBHost=&lt;database-host&gt;\nDBName=&lt;database-name&gt;\nDBSchema=&lt;database-schema&gt;  # Only for PostgreSQL\nDBUser=&lt;database-user&gt;\nDBPassword=&lt;database-password&gt;\nDBPort=&lt;database-port&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>&lt;database-host&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-name&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-schema&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-user&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-password&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;database-port&gt;</code> with the appropriate values for your setup.

Our menu on the left side of the screen has has a small overhaul. Let's dive into it. When we login into our Zabbix setup the first time with our Admin user we see a page</p> <p>like this where we have our <code>main window</code> in green our <code>main menu</code> marked in red and our <code>links</code> marked in yellow.</p> <p></p> <p>2.1 Overview</p> <p>The main menu can be hidden by collapsing it completely or to reduce it to a set of small icons. When we click on the button with the 2 arrows to the left:</p> <p></p> <p>2.2 Collapse</p> <p>You will see that the menu collapses to a set of small icons. Pressing \"&gt;&gt;\" will bring the <code>main menu</code> back to it's original state.</p> <p>When you click on the icon that looks like a box with an arrow sticking out, next to the \"&lt;&lt;\" button will hide the <code>main menu</code> completely.</p> <p></p> <p>2.3 Hide</p> <p>To bring back our <code>main menu</code> is rather easy, we just look for the button on the left with three horizontal lines and click on it. This will show the <code>main menu</code> but it won't stay. When we click on the box with the arrow now pointing to the bottom right it will keep the <code>main menu</code> back in it's position.</p> <p>Yet another way to make the screen bigger that is quite useful for monitors in <code>NOK teams</code> for example is the <code>kiosk mode</code> button. This one however is located on the left side of your screen and looks like 4 arrows pointing to every corner of the screen. Pressing this button will remove all the menus and leave only the <code>main window</code> to focus on.</p> <p></p> <p>2.4 Expand</p> <p>When we want to leave the kiosk mode, the button will be changed to 2 arrows pointing to the inside of the screen. Pressing this button will revert us back to the original state.</p> <p></p> <p>2.5 Shrink</p> Tip <p>We can also enter and exit kiosk mode by making use of parameters in our Zabbix url: <code>/zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view&amp;kiosk=1</code> - activate kiosk mode or <code>/zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view&amp;kiosk=0</code> - activate normal mode.</p> Note <p>There are many other page parameters we can use. A full list can be found at https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/7.4/en/manual/web_interface/page_parameters Zabbix also has a global search menu that we can use to find hosts, host groups and templates.</p> <p>If we type in the search box the word <code>server</code> you will see that we get an overview of all <code>templates</code>, <code>host groups</code> and <code>hosts</code> with the name server in it. That's why this is called the <code>global search</code> box.</p> <p></p> <p>2.6 Global search</p> <p>This is our result after we looked for the word <code>server</code>.

If no trapper is listening the rest of the information can not be displayed IP and port of the Zabbix server Zabbix server version This shows us the version of the <code>Zabbix server</code> so the version you see at the bottom of your screen is the one from the Zabbix frontend and can be different but should be in the same major version. Version Number Zabbix frontend version This is the version of the frontend and should match with what you see at the bottom of your screen. Version Number Number of hosts (enabled/disabled) The total number of hosts configured on our system How many of those are enabled and disabled Number of templates The number of templates installed on our Zabbix server. Number of items (enabled/disabled/not supported) This line shows us the number of items we have configured in total in this case 99 90 are enabled and 0 are disabled but 9 of them are unsupported. This last number is important as those are items not working. We will look into this later why it happens and how to fix it. For now remember that a high number of unsupported items is not a good idea. Number of triggers (Enabled/disabled[problem/ok]) The number of triggers configured Number of enabled and disabled triggers. Just as with items we also see if there are triggers that are in a problem state or ok state. A trigger in a problem state is a non working trigger something we need to monitor and fix. We will cover this also later. Number of users (online) Here we see the number of users that are configured on our system The number of users currently online. Required server performance, nvps The number of new values per second that Zabbix will process per second. This is just an estimated number as some values we get are unknown so the real value is probably higher. So we can have some indication about how many IOPS we need and how busy our database is. A better indication is probably the internal item <code>zabbix[wcache,values,all]</code> Global scripts on Zabbix server It notifies us that the Global scripts are enabled or disabled in the server config. Global scripts can be used in our frontend, actions, ... but need to be activated first High availability cluster It will show us if Zabbix HA cluster is disabled or not Failover delay once HA is activated Enabling Global script execution <p><code>Global script</code> execution on Zabbix server can be enabled by setting  <code>EnableGlobalScripts=1</code> in the Zabbix server configuration at <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/</code>.

Obviously, it gets all that only if the correct (from LDAP server perspective) username and password were provided. Then Zabbix goes through pre-configured mapping that defines users from which <code>LDAP group</code> goes to which <code>Zabbix user group</code>. If at least one match is found then a <code>Zabbix user</code> is created in the Zabbix database belonging to a <code>Zabbix user group</code> and having a <code>Zabbix user role</code> according to configured \u201cmatch\u201d. So far sounds pretty simple, right? Now let\u2019s go into details about how all this should be configured.</p> <p>In <code>Users | Authentication</code> we need to do two things:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Set <code>Default authentication</code> to LDAP. When JIT is turned off then type of   authentication is defined based on the User group a user that tries to login   belongs to. In case of JIT the user does not exist in Zabbix yet thus obviously   does not belong to any User group so Default method authentication is used   and we want it to be LDAP.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provide <code>Deprovisioned users group</code>. This group must be literally disabled   otherwise you won't be able to select it here. This is the Zabbix user group   where all de-provisioned users will be put into so effectively will get   disabled from accessing Zabbix.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>2.11 Default authentication</p> <p>Click <code>Update</code> button`.</p> <ul> <li>Enable JIT provisioning check-box which obviously needs to be checked for this   feature to work.

In case of a proxy or system crash, all data is retained and will be sent to the Zabbix server as soon as the proxy is started again.</p> <p>This is slower due to database I/O but is highly reliable.</p> <code>memory</code> - Memory buffer <p>Data is stored in RAM and is not written to disk. This makes sure the data is sent to the Zabbix server as quickly as possible as there is no I/O wait time for the database involved. Downside is that when the proxy or the system  crashes when the proxy still has data in the buffer, not yet received by the server, that data will be lost. Also when the RAM buffer overflows (<code>ProxyMemoryBufferSize</code>), possibly due to a sudden burst of incoming items or the Zabbix server being unavailable for some time, older data will be  removed from the buffer before it is sent to the Zabbix server.</p> <code>hybrid</code> - Hybrid buffer (default for new installations since Zabbix 7.0) <p>Data is primarily stored in RAM but is automatically written to the database when the memory buffer is full, the data is too old or when the proxy is  stopped. This makes sure that data is preserved in case the Zabbix server is unreachable for a longer period or when there are bursts of many incoming items and hereby balances speed and reliability.</p> Warning <p>In Proxies that where installed before <code>7.0</code> the data was first written to disk in the database and then sent to the <code>Zabbix server</code>. For these installations when we upgrade this remains the default behavior after upgrading to Zabbix 7.x or higher. It's now recommended for performance reasons to use the new setting <code>hybrid</code> and to define the <code>ProxyMemoryBufferSize</code>.</p> <p>Once you have made all the changes you need in the config file besides the ones we have covered, we only need to enable the service and start our proxy.

With the introduction of Zabbix 7.0, this behavior changed significantly. Now, configuration synchronization occurs much more frequently, every 10 seconds by default, but it's an incremental update. This means that instead of transferring the entire configuration, only the modified entities are synchronized, greatly improving efficiency and reducing network overhead.</p> <p>Upon initial proxy startup, a full configuration synchronization is still performed. Subsequently, both the server and the proxy maintain a revision of the configuration.

However, there is a native way in Zabbix which can do the very same thing without a need to involve any scripting. And that is something called \"Dependent items\".</p> <p>Think of \"Dependent items\" as small fragments of your large dataset. Of course, nothing limits or tells you that your dataset must be large. It can also be small, but the smaller - the less sense the dependent items would make. When having something large to be collected, you have to collect that data only once and have the splitting being done by preprocessing.</p> <p>Another use case when you might benefit from dependent items is when data collection has \"high cost\", in terms of time retrieving it or when network traffic matters. For example, some remote resource which you want to collect has slow network or you want to save each and every byte sent over the network, but there are multiple things in that resource which you want to monitor. Without dependent items approach you would need to retrieve that resource as many times as you have unique items, or store it once and then slice it on your own.

Some of the most used ones are important to properly understand their functioning. </p> <p>Regular expression Regular expressions are a whole subject on its own, there are many books on the topic on its own. We won't going over the details here, for that we recommend going to https://regex101.com. On this website you can read extensive documentation about regular expressions, as well as test your existing ones. </p> <p>Let's start with a basic example, where we have an item that received the value: The error is value: 0. Let's say we want to get numeric value from the string, we could configure our preprocessing like this.</p> <p> 4.37 Preprocessing regular expression</p> <p>This would then result in the value 0, which we can store as the <code>Numeric (unsigned)</code> item type of information. The basic functionality of the regular expression preprocessing step as you can see is to extract values from larger data.</p> <p>JSONPath and additional steps Within Zabbix monitoring, JSON data structures are used quite a lot. We can find it in Low Level Discovery, export files and it is often the data format sent back by API's. As such, being able to process JSON datasets is important and that is where JSONPath comes in. Let's say we have a basic JSON dataset we collected from an API.</p> <p>Example JSON</p> <pre><code>{\n\"hostname\": \"webserver01\",\n\"c\": true,\n\"retry_count\": 3\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now with JSONpath, we could extract these values. Let's say we want to get the <code>enabled</code> value and store it as a <code>Numeric (unsigned)</code> value. We could do the following.</p> <p> 4.38 Preprocessing JSONPath</p> <p>This will extract the value <code>true</code>. However, as a bonus we said we would also to store this extracted value as a <code>Numeric (unsigned)</code> value. To do this, I used an additional 2 preprocessing steps <code>replace</code>. Replacing <code>false</code> with <code>0</code> and <code>true</code> with <code>1</code>. If we press the <code>Test all steps</code> button, we can see the result happen live.</p> <p> 4.39 Preprocessing JSONPath test</p> <p>It's important to know that we can add an unlimited amount of preprocessing steps, but that Zabbix will always execute all of them in the order in which they are defined. First, we extract the value from JSON. Second, we try to replace <code>false</code> with <code>0</code> which didn't do anything as there was no match. Third, we replace <code>true</code> with <code>1</code> which worked. Now all we have to do is apply a value mapping to translate true and false back into human readable format. The big benefit here being that storing these kinds of values as <code>Numeric (unsigned)</code> gives us a lot more trigger functions as options for alerting. It also means we can now store the value in <code>Trend</code> tables, as only <code>Numeric</code> data types are stores as trends.</p> <p>SNMP walk value </p> <p>SNMP walk to JSON</p> <p>Custom multiplier  The customer multiplier is simple, but important. In Zabbix you might often find that you receive a value, that you would want to store slightly differently. Specifically, this preprocessing step is often used to convert numbers to their base value. Your device might be giving you MegaBytes (MB) for example, where Zabbix would like us to store Bytes (B) instead. </p> <p> 4.40 Preprocessing Custom Multiplier</p> <p>This will now store the received MegaByte value as Bytes. Now, we can set the item <code>Units</code> setting to B and it will convert the Bytes stored to a human readable Mega, Giga, Tera, etc.</p> <p>Storing base values is always preferred in Zabbix, so we can do the conversion with <code>Units</code> on the item later. This results in a more dynamic setup.</p> <p>Simple Change and Change per second We quickly mentioned the <code>Simple Change</code> before, which calculates the difference between <code>Last</code> and <code>Previous</code> value. Change per second goes a step further however by introducing a time based calculation to the formula. </p> <p>A simple change calculation would look like this.</p> Position Value Last #1 9 Last #2 (previous) 4 ----- 5 <p>We can see the result here is a simple 5, using the formula <code>Last - Previous</code>. In Zabbix the last received value is often indicated by <code>Last #1</code> and the value before it as <code>Last #2</code>. Next, let's introduce the time based calculation with <code>Change per second</code>, so we see something more difficult.</p> Position Value Timestamp (Unixtime) Change per second Last #1 13 1763282130 7 Last #2 (previous) 6 1763282100 30 ---- - ------------------- - -------------------- / 7 30 0.23333333 <p>We can see the calculation is the same in principle, we subtract <code>Last #1</code> and <code>Last #2</code>. We also takes the Unixtime stamp of when <code>Last #1</code> and <code>Last #2</code> were collected, subtracting those. Subtracting those time values gives us the time passed between <code>Last #1</code> and <code>Last #2</code>. Then the last step is to divide the values, giving us an estimate of how much values were received per second. Of course, the shorter our update interval is, the closer the estimate. But it gives us an accurate average over time.</p> <p>This kind of calculation works with what we call <code>Counters</code>, values that always increase on our monitoring targets. For example, network interfaces Bits received/sent are often times counters. These work by calculating how much data has passed over the interface in total, often since the last reboot. Often times, a useless metric to us unless we convert it with <code>Change per second</code> when it gives us a nice <code>Bits/s</code>. This allows us to monitor network traffic over time, instead of just a total. </p> <p>Javascript With  many APIs out there being used to make monitoring data available to us, responses are getting more complex. It might happen that you get a response that isn't perfect for us to store in Zabbix. One of my favourite examples is dates and times. Sometimes developers might decide to gives us back a string value with the dates, for example:</p> <ul> <li>Aug 21 1991</li> <li>Aug 24 1991</li> <li>May 8 1945</li> </ul> <p>Using Javascript, we could convert these dates into a nice <code>Unixtime</code> stamp. Unixtime is something Zabbix understands as a Unit and can be used in trigger functions. </p> <p>Example Javascript</p> <pre><code>// Expecting: \"Feb 20 2040\"\n    var months = {\n        Jan: 0, Feb: 1, Mar: 2, Apr: 3, May: 4, Jun: 5,\n        Jul: 6, Aug: 7, Sep: 8, Oct: 9, Nov: 10, Dec: 11\n    };\n\n    if (typeof value !== 'string') {\n        return value;\n    }\n\n    // Split on whitespace\n    var parts = value.trim().split(/\\s+/);\n    if (parts.length !== 3) {\n        return value; // or throw, depending on how strict you want to be\n    }\n\n    var monStr = parts[0];\n    var day = parseInt(parts[1], 10);\n    var year = parseInt(parts[2], 10);\n\n    var month = months[monStr];\n    if (month === undefined || isNaN(day) || isNaN(year)) {\n        return value;\n    }\n\n    // Use UTC midnight of that date, convert ms \u2192 seconds\n    var ts = Date.UTC(year, month, day) / 1000;\n\n    return ts;\n</code></pre> <p>Keep in mind, Zabbix will already put this Javascript code in a function for preprocessing as <code>function (value) { }</code>. When testing this code, we can see it executed for us now, converting out weird date format into a nice Unixtime.</p> <p> 4.41 Preprocessing Javascript</p> <p>Discard unchanged with heartbeat  Shortly, I'd also like to discuss the <code>Discard unchanged with heartbeat</code> preprocessing in more detail. Let's say we set up our preprocessing step <code>Discard unchanged with heartbeat</code> with a heartbeat value of <code>5m</code>. We might see the following happen.</p> <p>| Value | Timestamp | Stored value? | | :---- | :-------- | |   0   |    Now    | No |   0   |   1m ago  | Yes |   1   |   2m ago  | Yes |   1   |   3m ago  | No |   1   |   4m ago  | No |   1   |   5m ago  | No |   1   |   6m ago  | No |   1   |   7m ago  | No |   1   |   8m ago  | Yes |   0   |   9m ago  | Yes</p> <p>We can see that we only store the value if it changes from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code> or from <code>1</code> to <code>0</code> in this case. However, at the <code>2m ago</code> timestamp we can see an exception. This specific value had passed the 5 minute heartbeat interval, meaning we store this value even though it had not changed yet. This can be used to make sure we still save a value from time to time, which can be useful for data integrity or crafting your trigger expressions later on.</p>","tags":["advanced"]},{"location":"ch04-zabbix-collecting-data/preprocessing/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>As we can see preprocessing can be used to turns raw received data into structured, meaningful monitoring data.

This chapter introduces an alternative approach monitoring via SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) which does not require the installation of a Zabbix agent on the monitored device. This method is especially useful in environments where agent based monitoring is impractical, restricted or simply not allowed.</p> <p>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely adopted protocol designed for monitoring and managing devices on IP networks. Despite the word \"management\" in its name, SNMP is predominantly employed for monitoring purposes. Its widespread support across networking hardware and embedded systems has made it a cornerstone of modern network visibility solutions.</p> <p>Originally developed in the late 1980s, SNMP has undergone several revisions. Early versions, such as SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, were hampered by significant security limitations. As a result, while SNMP includes functionality for remote device configuration, its use has remained largely to status monitoring rather than active management of devices.</p> <p>SNMP is especially valuable for monitoring resource constrained or embedded devices that lack the capacity to run a full monitoring agent.</p> <p>Common examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Printers</li> <li>Network switches, routers, and firewalls</li> <li>Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs)</li> <li>NAS (Network-Attached Storage) appliances</li> <li>Environmental sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity sensors)</li> </ul> <p>These devices often provide built-in SNMP support, making them accessible for monitoring with minimal configuration. Additionally, SNMP can be employed on standard servers where installing or maintaining a Zabbix agent is either impractical or not permitted. This could be due to administrative policies, software compatibility or security concerns, or simply a desire to reduce system footprint.</p> <p>Recognizing the ubiquity of SNMP, Zabbix provides native SNMP support. This capability is powered by the open-source Net-SNMP suite, available at http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net. The integration allows Zabbix to retrieve metrics from SNMP-enabled devices using industry standard mechanisms.</p> <p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p> <ul> <li>An introduction to the Net-SNMP toolkit and its core utilities.</li> <li>How to integrate MIB (Management Information Base) files into Zabbix, enabling   the platform to interpret SNMP data correctly.</li> <li>The process of SNMP polling within Zabbix, including how to define SNMP-based   items and retrieve data from devices.</li> </ul> <p>This chapter serves as the foundation for SNMP-based monitoring in Zabbix. While we begin with the essentials such as polling, MIB usage, and SNMP item configuration this is just the start.</p> <p>Later in this book, we will build upon this knowledge by exploring Low-Level Discovery (LLD) mechanisms using SNMP.

Sometimes, we see this as passive mode was being used but an active only check is added later. The Zabbix agent in active mode can execute all item keys, whereas the passive agent cannot execute log item keys. Another reason to prefer active mode in most cases. For clarity, in our example we will use a different linux and windows server for the active agent. We will call these hosts:</p> <ul> <li>zbx-agent-active-rocky</li> <li>zbx-agent-active-windows</li> </ul> <p>Because the Zabbix active agent will need to know where to request its configuration and where to start sending data, the setup for the active agent is quite different. The set-up process however is the same for both Linux and Windows. Let's start by editing the Zabbix agent configuration file.</p> <p>open Zabbix agent configuration file</p> <p>Linux usually:</p> <p>``` vim /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent2.conf <pre><code>Windows usually:\n\n``` Open C:\\Program Files\\Zabbix agent\\zabbix_agent2.conf with a text editor\n</code></pre></p> <p>Once the configuration is open, there are two important parameters in the configuration file.

Do not forget to remove <code>127.0.0.1</code> in this case. Its important to remember that our Zabbix agent in active mode will connect to every single IP address or DNS name entered in the <code>ServerActive=</code> parameter. Unlike <code>Server=</code> which functions as an allowlist.</p> <p>Next up, our Zabbix agent needs to know which configuration data to collect. It will connect to the Zabbix server (or proxy) on the IP specified and send over its <code>Hostname=</code> parameter. By default this is set to <code>Hostname=Zabbix server</code> which is incorrect in all cases except the Zabbix server itself. Lets change the configuration.</p> <p>edit Hostname parameter</p> <p>Linux:</p> <p>``` Hostname=zbx-agent-active-rocky <pre><code>Windows\n\n``` Hostname=zbx-agent-active-windows\n</code></pre></p> <p>It is also possible to comment the <code>#Hostname=</code> parameters, in which case it will use the <code>system.hostname</code> item key to determine the hostname. This makes it easy for environments where the hostname is the same on the system as it will be in Zabbix (best practice).</p> <p>There is also the <code>HostnameItem=</code> parameter which you can use to set your own item to determine the hostname used. This can be an existing item, but also a <code>UserParameter</code> (more on those later). With this functionality, you can even execute a bash or powershell script to set a custom hostname like that.</p> <p>With this configuration set you can restart the Zabbix agent to make the changes take effect. In <code>Windows</code> restart the service, for <code>Linux</code> issue the command below.</p> <p>restart Zabbix agent</p> <p><code>systemctl restart zabbix-agent2</code></p> <p>This finalizes the configuration file changes.

Subgroups allow administrators to build organized, multi-level collections of templates, which improves navigation and permission granularity.</p> <p>Subgroups are created in Zabbix by adding a <code>/</code> in the group names. For example if we want to create a group <code>Databases</code> as a subgroup of <code>Templates</code> then we only need to create the new group like this: <code>Templates/Databases</code>. However it's recommended to create <code>Templates</code> first.</p> <p>Example hierarchy:</p> <pre><code>Templates\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Operating Systems\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Linux\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Windows\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Network Appliances\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Applications\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Databases\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 PostgreSQL\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 MySQL\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Oracle\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Web Servers\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Hierarchy for organization and permissions only: Subgroups do not change how   templates link to hosts; they are purely structural.</li> <li>Automatic downward inheritance: If a user group has RW or RO access to a   parent template group, that access automatically extends to all its existing   subgroups. You can still assign explicit permissions on individual subgroups   to override inherited rights.</li> <li>Parent-creation edge case: When you create a new parent group for an already   existing subgroup (for example, creating Applications when Applications/Databases   already exists), no permissions are automatically assigned to the new parent.   Administrators must manually grant permissions on the parent group if required.</li> <li>Search and filtering benefits: The hierarchical view makes it easier to locate   and manage templates in large environments.</li> <li>Consistency with host groups: Subgroup behavior and inheritance are identical   for host groups and template groups, providing a uniform organizational model.</li> </ul> Tip <p>Use top-level groups for broad classifications (e.g., Templates/Applications) and subgroups for vendor or technology specialization.

It allows you to automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows, and gain deeper insights into your infrastructure. Whether you're automating routine checks, creating custom dashboards, or integrating with external systems, the knowledge you've gained here will enable you to effectively leverage Zabbix.</p> <p>Remember, the examples and techniques presented in this book provide a foundation. The true power of Zabbix frontend scripts lies in their flexibility and your ability to adapt them to your specific needs. As you continue to explore and experiment, you'll discover new ways to enhance your monitoring capabilities and optimize your Zabbix setup.</p>","tags":["advanced"]},{"location":"ch09-zabbix-extending/frontend-scripts/#questions","title":"Questions","text":"<ul> <li>Why are Zabbix frontend scripts useful?</li> <li>What are some ways Zabbix frontend scripts can help automate tasks?</li> <li>Why is it important to configure user and host permissions when using Zabbix frontend scripts?</li> </ul>","tags":["advanced"]},{"location":"ch09-zabbix-extending/frontend-scripts/#useful-urls","title":"Useful URLs","text":"<ul> <li>https://blog.zabbix.com/setting-up-manual-ticket-creation-using-zabbix-frontend-scripts/15550/</li> <li>https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/administration/scripts</li> <li>https://github.com/Trikke76/Zabbix/tree/master/maintenance</li> </ul>","tags":["advanced"]},{"location":"ch09-zabbix-extending/user-parameters/","title":"User Parameters","text":"","tags":["advanced"]},{"location":"ch09-zabbix-extending/user-parameters/#what-is-userparameter-and-when-to-use-it","title":"What is <code>UserParameter</code> and when to use it?","text":"<p><code>UserParameter</code> is one of the ways to tell Zabbix agent that you want to collect something custom.</p> <p>\"Custom\" in this context of data collection means something that is not already provided as an item by Zabbix agent. So before implementing anything custom, be sure that Zabbix doesn't provide it already out-of-the-box - either directly or in combination with some other Zabbix native features, such as preprocessing or dependent items. For example, you would not use it to measure CPU load, since Zabbix agent has <code>system.cpu.load[]</code> item. Or you would not use it for simply getting one line from some file because there is <code>vfs.file.contents[]</code> which you can combine with preprocessing to extract specific line.</p> <p>Configuring <code>UserParameter</code> is pretty straightforward and benefits can be enormous, depending on your abilities to correctly collect and structure the data of your interest. In the end, it is something that Zabbix agent executes in order to collect data. It can be simple one liner or some sophisticated sequence of commands. So it is highly related to one's ability to write those \"to be executed\" commands in neat and efficient manner.</p> <p>Main benefit of <code>UserParameter</code> is that logic behind data collection can be absolutely anything. You have total freedom, there is no dependency on specific technologies, programming languages or frameworks. There is basically one main requirement \u2013 Zabbix agent should be able to execute whatever you provide for it as a command and it should produce some (hopefully meaningful) output.</p> Tip <p><code>UserParameter</code> can be used not only to collect data, but also as a custom LLD (Low level discovery) rule.</p> <p>There are some other methods that allow you to collect custom data:</p> <ul> <li><code>zabbix_sender</code></li> <li>Zabbix API (via <code>history.push</code>)</li> <li><code>system.run[]</code> item</li> </ul> <p>Those are all great ways and have some clear use cases when you want to use each of them. However, <code>UserParameter</code> is probably the most common and most widely adopted way. It is kind of a perfect balance between simplicity in setting it up and flexibility it brings. For example:</p> <ul> <li>once setting <code>UserParameter</code> up you don't have to care about running it and also about checking interval. Zabbix agent will take care of running it and you'll set checking frequency in Zabbix GUI once creating item there (opposite to <code>zabbix_sender</code> case which is kind of a standalone in relation to Zabbix server, thus you have to take care of running it on your own)</li> <li>there is no need to take care of communication with Zabbix server itself or knowing your item ID (opposite to Zabbix API approach)</li> </ul>","tags":["advanced"]},{"location":"ch09-zabbix-extending/user-parameters/#creating-a-userparameter","title":"Creating a <code>UserParameter</code>","text":"<p><code>UserParameter</code> is available for any OS where Zabbix agent can be installed.

If you add them incorrectly, agent will stop and fail to start once being restarted, thus better idea is to check it in advance with <code>zabbix_agentd -t</code>. For example, here we have duplicated entries (same item key defined twice):</p> <pre><code>zabbix@binary:/$ cat /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/userparameter_book.conf\nUserParameter=my.user.parameter,echo \"Hello World\"\nUserParameter=my.user.parameter,echo \"Hello World 2\"\nzabbix@binary:/$ zabbix_agentd -t my.user.parameter\nzabbix_agentd [1505972]: ERROR: cannot load user parameters: user parameter \"my.user.parameter,echo \"Hello World 2\"\": key \"my.user.parameter\" already exists\nzabbix@binary:/$\n</code></pre> <p>After removing the duplicate and checking once again, we will get value for the defined item:</p> <pre><code>zabbix@binary:/$ cat /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/userparameter_book.conf\nUserParameter=my.user.parameter,echo \"Hello World\"\nzabbix@binary:/$ zabbix_agentd -t my.user.parameter\nmy.user.parameter                             [t|Hello World]\nzabbix@binary:/$\n</code></pre> <p>Make it executable and reachable</p> <p>If <code>UserParameter</code> is a script and your environment is *nix, don't forget to make it executable. Also, you will most likely craft your script under some different user than the one Zabbix agent is running under (user <code>zabbix</code> by default), so make sure this very user can run it (e.g. permissions to reach script itself or do anything that is being done inside the script). Best way to test it is to switch to this user and try to run it. For example, here we forget that one of the directories in path where our script lives is not reachable by anyone except us. So, it might look like this script is working, but it is working just for us:</p> <pre><code>binary@binary:~$ /opt/scripts/binary/my.sh\nHello World\nbinary@binary:~$ sudo -u zabbix bash -c \"cd / &amp;&amp; exec bash\"\nzabbix@binary:/$ /opt/scripts/binary/my.sh\nbash: /opt/scripts/binary/my.sh: Permission denied\nzabbix@binary:/$ whoami\nzabbix\nzabbix@binary:/$ exit\nexit\nbinary@binary:~$ namei -mo /opt/scripts/binary/my.sh\nf: /opt/scripts/binary/my.sh\n drwxr-xr-x root   root   /\n drwxr-xr-x root   root   opt\n drwxrwxrwt root   root   scripts\n drwxrwx--- binary binary binary\n -rwxrwxr-x binary binary my.sh\nbinary@binary:~$\n</code></pre> <p>Be as fast as possible</p> <p>Always pay attention to how long it takes for your <code>UserParameter</code> to collect data. If it runs for too long you might hit Zabbix agent timeout. This timeout is configurable on item level, so you can adjust it:</p> <p></p> <p>Also, be wise with number of such items. If you have many, especially more heavy ones, observe if it doesn't affect overall agent (or even host itself!) performance in collecting data. If checks are set to be in \"active\" mode and run for relatively long time, they will eventually start blocking other active checks, because active checks (on classic Agent, not Agent 2) are not processed in parallel.</p> <p>Use dependent items for splitting</p> <p>If there are many similar data points to be collected, avoid having separate <code>UserParameter</code> for each of them.

This extension is not only powerful and efficient, it is also the only method officially supported by Zabbix for database partitioning.

Consistently high utilization (approaching 100%) is a critical performance indicator, suggesting that the configured number of processes (Start) is insufficient to handle the current monitoring load. <p>If a process like the poller remains overloaded, it directly causes item collection delays, pushing new check requests into the queue.

If the server is functioning correctly, the total queue length <code>zabbix[queue,5m]</code> should remain low and stable.</p> <p>Zabbix categorizes queued items by their delay, providing buckets for items waiting for more than 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes (as seen in the internal metric <code>zabbix[queue,&lt;from&gt;,&lt;to&gt;]</code> and the <code>Queue overview</code> page).

If Zabbix processes need data that isn't in memory, they must perform expensive, synchronous database queries, severely impacting the overall throughput.</p> <p>The most critical cache is the Configuration Cache. This cache holds the entire monitoring setup (hosts, items, triggers, etc.). Its size is governed by the primary CacheSize parameter in the zabbix_server.conf file. Crucially, Zabbix does not expose a direct internal item to monitor the free space or utilization of the Configuration Cache. Its health is inferred from general server performance issues and related log file warnings.</p> <p>Other essential caches, such as the History Cache and the Trend Cache, do report their status.

A physical backup can be either consistent or non-consistent, also called \"hot\". A consistent backup can be restored as is, but a non-consistent backup has to be recovered using archived log files. Taking a  consistent backup usually has performance implications, as all writes to the  datafiles must be postponed for the duration of the backup.  A logical backup can only restore data to the point in time where the dump has been taken, while a physical backup can be recovered to any point in time using  the archived logs. For this reason, a physical backup is a more secure and and mature method of protecting the database when compared to a logical backup. However, since Zabbix does not handle financial transactions, but only observations,  alerts and similar, it is usually not a big deal, if the backups are done with dumps instead of physical backups. Zabbix relies heavily on the underlying database not only for the collected items (metrics), but also for storing the Zabbix configuration we create in the Zabbix frontend. This database should either be a MariaDB, PostgreSQL or MySQL database in Zabbix 8.0 as those are the official production supported database types.</p> <p>Since our history, trends and configuration data is all stored in this central database, taking a meaningful backup of our Zabbix environment is fairly simple. All we have to do is pick a backup method we like for our chosen database and then use that to backup the database. Giving you a backup you can easily restore 99% of your Zabbix environment with.</p> <p>Easily forgotten, there are also some important configuration files and you might even have some scripts hanging around on your filesystem that you need to backup. The configuration files could be restored manually with not too much effort, but those scripts could especially take a long time to restore. As such it is always important to also backup these additional files. We will explore both the database and file backups in this topic within the book.</p> <p>Various options exist for creating a database backup. Dumping the database content to a flat file is the easiest and simplest method. Physical backups requires more effort, usually installing a backup agent and configuring the backup software as well as configuring the database to run with  archiving of the database logs, and continous deletion of the archived logs. With regular backups of the database and the archived logs, a restore is possible  to the latest committed transaction in most databases.</p> <p>For dumping the contents of the database, various tools exists:</p> <ul> <li><code>mariadb-dump utility</code>: This is a built-in tool shipped with MariaDB, allowing you   to create reliable .sql file dumps of the MariaDB database. It creates a file with   SQL statements, allowing us to restore our database.</li> <li><code>mysqldump utility</code>: This tool allows us to do the same as mariadb-dump, but is   the official MySQL variant. Keep in mind that MariaDB and MySQL are going in   different directions with their codebase, so it is recommended to use the right   tool for your database.</li> <li><code>pg_dump utility</code>: PostgreSQL also has a built-in tool to allow us to create .sql   file dumps of our PostgreSQL database. This creates a very similar .sql file with   SQL statements, allowing us to restore our database fully.</li> <li><code>(Virtual) Machine disk snapshots</code>: There are various utilities on the market to   create (incremental) snapshots of a database server. Some examples are snapshots   built into Azure/Amazon AWS, Proxmox PBS server, Veeam, Rubrik and more.

It may feel self contained once it is running, but it is quietly shaped by the operating system beneath it, sometimes in ways that only become visible years later.</p> <p>One of the most striking examples of this is the C standard library.</p> <p>Database engines rely on the system\u2019s C library for fundamental operations such as string comparison, sorting, and collation. When that library changes, the rules of order can change with it. What was considered correctly sorted yesterday may no longer be considered correct tomorrow.</p> <p>This is not hypothetical.</p> <p>During major Linux distribution upgrades such as the transition from CentOS 6 to 7, or across certain Ubuntu releases the underlying C library changed its collation behavior. Databases that were perfectly healthy before the upgrade suddenly contained indexes that no longer matched the new sorting rules.</p> <p>Nothing was \u201cbroken\u201d. Queries still worked. Data was still there. But indexes were now built on assumptions that no longer held true.</p> <p>The only correct response in such situations is a rebuild.</p> <p>That is why database upgrades that coincide with operating system changes often benefit from index rebuilds, table rewrites, or full reindexing operations. Not because the database engine failed, but because the environment it depends on has evolved.</p> <p>\u201cA database upgraded without reindexing is carrying yesterday\u2019s sorting rules into today's system.\u201d</p> <p>Ignoring this can lead to subtle and difficult-to-diagnose issues: degraded performance, unexpected query plans, or in rare cases, incorrect index usage. These problems do not announce themselves loudly. They simply erode confidence over time.</p> <p>Reindexing after a major OS or database upgrade is not superstition. It is an acknowledgement that databases inherit behavior from the systems they run on and that those systems do change.</p> Note <p>Historically, major upgrades of CentOS, Ubuntu, and SUSE Linux Enterprise have  all introduced updates to core system libraries, including the C standard library. In some cases, these updates altered collation and sorting behavior in ways that directly affected database indexes.</p>","tags":["advanced","expert"]},{"location":"ch14-zabbix-maintenance/upgrades/#postgresql-upgrade-and-migration-strategies","title":"PostgreSQL: Upgrade and Migration Strategies","text":"<p>PostgreSQL offers administrators an unusual degree of flexibility when it comes to upgrades. That flexibility is a strength but only if it is understood.</p> <p>For smaller Zabbix installations, the most straightforward approach is often a logical dump and restore. A new PostgreSQL version is installed, data is exported from the old system, and restored into the new one. This method is slow, sometimes painfully so, but it has one decisive advantage: every table, index, and object is rebuilt from scratch using the new database engine and the current system libraries.</p> <p>It is difficult to carry historical baggage through a dump and restore, which is precisely why it remains such a reliable option.</p> <p>Larger environments tend to follow a different path. When databases grow to hundreds of gigabytes or more, full logical restores become impractical. In these cases, PostgreSQL\u2019s native upgrade tooling is often used to perform an in-place upgrade.</p> <p>This is where installing multiple PostgreSQL versions side by side becomes important.</p> <p>Tools such as pg_upgrade rely on having both the old and the new PostgreSQL binaries available at the same time. By explicitly controlling which binaries operate on a given data directory, administrators can perform a fast upgrade while preserving the existing data layout. When executed correctly, this approach dramatically reduces downtime compared to logical migrations.</p> <p>Some teams take this one step further by carefully structuring filesystem layouts or using symbolic links to ensure that data directories remain stable while binaries change around them. This is not casual administration, it requires discipline, documentation, and rehearsals but it allows upgrades to be repeatable and predictable even at scale.</p> <p>\u201cFast upgrades are never accidental. They are designed long before they are needed.\u201d</p> <p>Regardless of the chosen method, PostgreSQL upgrades benefit enormously from a few consistent practices.</p> <p>Testing the upgrade process on a restored copy of the database removes uncertainty. Performing explicit reindexing after major operating system or engine upgrades ensures that indexes reflect the behavior of the new environment. Verifying extensions particularly TimescaleDB before starting Zabbix prevents avoidable startup failures.</p> <p>PostgreSQL provides the tools to upgrade safely.

Please refrain from installing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or desktop environments, as they are unnecessary for server setups and consume valuable resources.</p> <p>Once you have your preferred OS installed, there are a few essential configurations to perform before proceeding with the Zabbix installation.

A firewall is a crucial security component that helps protect your server from unauthorized access and potential threats by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</p> <p>Pour installer et activer le pare-feu, ex\u00e9cutez la commande suivante :</p> <p>Installer et activer le pare-feu</p> <p>Red Hat <pre><code>dnf install firewalld\nsystemctl enable firewalld --now\n</code></pre> SUSE <pre><code>zypper install firewalld\nsystemctl enable firewalld --now\n</code></pre></p> <p>Ubuntu <pre><code>sudo apt install ufw\nsudo ufw enable\n</code></pre></p> What is firewalld / ufw <p>Firewalld is the replacement for iptables in RHEL- and SUSE-based systems and allows changes to take effect immediately without needing to restart the service. If your distribution does not use Firewalld, refer to your OS documentation for the appropriate firewall configuration steps. Ubuntu makes use of UFW which is merely a frontend for iptables.</p> <p>During the Zabbix installation in the next chapters, we will need to open specific ports in the firewall to allow communication between Zabbix components.</p> <p>Alternatively to just opening ports, as we will do in the next chapters, you can also choose to define dedicated firewall zones for specific use cases. This approach enhances security by isolating services and restricting access based on trust levels. For example...</p> <p>Create a firewalld zone for database access</p> <pre><code>firewall-cmd --new-zone=db_zone --permanent\n</code></pre> <p>Vous pouvez valider la cr\u00e9ation de la zone en ex\u00e9cutant la commande suivante :</p> <p>Verify the zone creation</p> <pre><code>localhost:~ # firewall-cmd --get-zones\nblock dmz drop external home internal nm-shared db_zone public trusted work\n</code></pre> <p>Using zones in firewalld to configure firewall rules provides several advantages in terms of security, flexibility, and ease of management. Here\u2019s why zones are beneficial:</p> <ul> <li>Contr\u00f4le d'acc\u00e8s granulaire :</li> </ul> Firewalld zones allow different levels of trust for different network interfaces and IP ranges. You can define which systems are allowed to connect to PostgreSQL based on their trust level. <ul> <li>Gestion simplifi\u00e9e des r\u00e8gles :</li> </ul> Instead of manually defining complex iptables rules, zones provide an organized way to group and manage firewall rules based on usage scenarios. <ul> <li>S\u00e9curit\u00e9 renforc\u00e9e :</li> </ul> By restricting application access to a specific zone, you prevent unauthorized connections from other interfaces or networks. <ul> <li>Configuration dynamique :</li> </ul> Firewalld supports runtime and permanent rule configurations, allowing changes without disrupting existing connections. <ul> <li>Prise en charge de plusieurs interfaces :</li> </ul> If the server has multiple network interfaces, zones allow different security policies for each interface. <p>Bringing everything together to add a zone for, in this example, PostgreSQL it would look like this:</p> <p>Firewalld with zone config for PostgreSQL database access</p> <pre><code>firewall-cmd --new-zone=db_zone --permanent\nfirewall-cmd --zone=db_zone --add-service=postgresql --permanent\nfirewall-cmd --zone=db_zone --add-source=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/32 --permanent\nfirewall-cmd --reload\n</code></pre> <p>Lorsque la <code>source IP</code> est la seule adresse autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une connexion avec la base de donn\u00e9es.</p> <p>If you wish to use zones when using firewalld, ensure to adapt the instructions in the following chapters accordingly.</p>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"fr/ch00-getting-started/Requirements/#serveur-de-temps","title":"Serveur de temps","text":"<p>Une autre \u00e9tape cruciale consiste \u00e0 configurer le serveur de temps et \u00e0 synchroniser le serveur Zabbix \u00e0 l'aide d'un client NTP.

Zabbix supports several database options: MySQL/Percona, MariaDB, PostgreSQL (including TimescaleDB), and Oracle (up to Zabbix 7.0).</p> Oracle Database deprecation <p>Zabbix 7.0 marks the final release to offer support for Oracle Database. Consequently, systems running Zabbix 7.0 or any prior version must undertake a database migration to either PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a compatible fork such as MariaDB before upgrading to a later Zabbix release. This migration is a mandatory step to ensure continued functionality and compatibility with future Zabbix versions.</p> <p>All supported databases perform similarly under typical Zabbix workloads, and Zabbix treats them equally in terms of functionality. As such, the choice primarily depends on your or your team\u2019s familiarity with a particular database system. One notable exception is TimescaleDB, a PostgreSQL extension optimized for time-series data. This makes it especially well-suited for monitoring applications like Zabbix, which handle large volumes of timestamped data.</p> <p>In large-scale environments with high-frequency data collection, TimescaleDB can deliver significant performance benefits, including improved query speeds and built-in compression to reduce storage requirements. However, these advantages come with added complexity during installation and a few restrictions on historical data retention.</p> TimescaleDB installation <p>Given its advanced nature, TimescaleDB is not essential for most Zabbix users.

To administer the database, you will need to execute commands as the <code>postgres</code> user.</p> <p>First, create the Zabbix server database user (also referred to as a \"role\" in PostgreSQL):</p> <p>Create server users</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt zabbix-srv\nEnter password for new role: &lt;server-password&gt;\nEnter it again: &lt;server-password&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Next, create the Zabbix frontend user, which will be used to connect to the database:</p> <p>Create front-end user</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt zabbix-web\nEnter password for new role: &lt;frontend-password&gt;\nEnter it again: &lt;frontend-password&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now with the users created, the next step is to create the Zabbix database. Execute the following command to create the database <code>zabbix</code> with the owner set to <code>zabbix-srv</code> and the character encoding set to <code>Unicode</code> as required by Zabbix:</p> <p>Create DB</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createdb -E Unicode -T template0 -O zabbix-srv zabbix\n</code></pre> What is this 'template0'? <p>In PostgreSQL, <code>template0</code> is a default database template that serves as a pristine copy of the database system. When creating a new database using <code>template0</code>, it ensures that the new database starts with a clean slate, without any pre-existing objects or configurations that might be present in other templates. This is particularly useful when you want to create a database with specific settings or extensions without inheriting any unwanted elements from other templates.</p> <p>Once the database is created, you should verify the connection and ensure that the correct user session is active. To do this, log into the zabbix database using the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Login as user zabbix-srv</p> <pre><code>psql -d zabbix -U zabbix-srv\n</code></pre> <p>After logging in, run the following SQL query to confirm that both the <code>session_user</code> and <code>current_user</code> are set to <code>zabbix-srv</code>:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SELECT session_user, current_user;\n session_user | current_user\n--------------+--------------\n zabbix-srv   | zabbix-srv\n(1 row)\n</code></pre> <p>If the output matches, you are successfully connected to the database with the correct user.</p> <p>PostgreSQL differs significantly from MySQL or MariaDB in several aspects, and one of the key features that sets it apart is its use of schemas. Unlike MySQL, where databases are more standalone, PostgreSQL's schema system provides a structured, multi-user environment within a single database.</p> <p>Schemas act as logical containers within a database, enabling multiple users or applications to access and manage data independently without conflicts. This feature is especially valuable in environments where several users or applications need to interact with the same database server concurrently. Each user or application can have its own schema, preventing accidental interference with each other's data.</p> Note <p>PostgreSQL comes with a default schema, typically called <code>public</code>, but in general, it's a best practice to create custom schemas to better organize and separate database objects, especially in complex or multi-user environments.</p> <p>For more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the detailed guide at this URI, https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-schema/#schema which explains the benefits and use cases for schemas in PostgreSQL.</p> <p>To finalize the initial database setup for Zabbix, we need to configure schema permissions for both the <code>zabbix-srv</code> and <code>zabbix-web</code> users.</p> <p>First, we create a custom schema named <code>zabbix_server</code> and assign ownership to the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Create the db schema</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; CREATE SCHEMA zabbix_server AUTHORIZATION \"zabbix-srv\";\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we set the <code>search path</code> to <code>zabbix_server</code> schema so that it's the default for the current session:</p> <p>Set search path</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SET search_path TO \"zabbix_server\";\n</code></pre> Tip <p>If you prefer not to set the search path manually each time you log in as the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user, you can configure PostgreSQL to automatically use the desired search path. Run the following SQL command to set the default search path for the <code>zabbix-srv</code> role:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; ALTER ROLE \"zabbix-srv\" SET search_path = zabbix_server;\n</code></pre> <p>This command ensures that every time the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user connects to the database, the <code>search_path</code> is automatically set to <code>zabbix_server</code>.</p> <p>To confirm the schema setup, you can list the existing schemas:</p> <p>Verify schema access</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\dn\n          List of schemas\n     Name      |       Owner\n---------------+-------------------\n public        | pg_database_owner\n zabbix_server | zabbix-srv\n(2 rows)\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user has full access to the schema, but the <code>zabbix-web</code> user still needs appropriate permissions to connect and interact with the database. First, we grant <code>USAGE</code> privileges on the schema to allow <code>zabbix-web</code> to connect:</p> <p>Grant access to schema for user zabbix-web</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA zabbix_server TO \"zabbix-web\";\n</code></pre> <p>Now, the <code>zabbix-web</code> user has appropriate access to interact with the schema while maintaining security by limiting permissions to essential operations.</p> <p>If you are ready you can exit the database and return to your linux shell.</p> <p>Exit the database shell</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\q\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, your Zabbix database is ready, but before it can actually be used by Zabbix, we still need to populate the database with the necessary tables and initial data, but that will be covered in the next section when we install the Zabbix server.</p> <p>If you intent to install Zabbix server on a different machine than the one hosting the database you will need to open the host firewall to allow incoming connections to the database server.

By default PHP-FPM is not allowed by SELinux on SUSE to - map exec memory required for PHP JIT compilation, - connect to Zabbix server or - connect to the database server over TCP. We need to tell SELinux to allow all   this:</p> <p>SELinux: Allow PHP-FPM to map exec memory</p> <pre><code>setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1\n</code></pre> Tip <p>To troubleshoot SELinux issues, it is recommended to install the <code>setroubleshoot</code> package which will log any SELinux denials in the system log and provide suggestions on how to resolve them.</p> <p>Depending on your Linux distribution defaults, PHP-FPM may by default not be allowed by SystemD to write to the <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> directory required for the Zabbix frontend setup. To enable this we need to create a drop-in file to allow this:</p> <p>SystemD: Allow PHP-FPM to write to /etc/zabbix/web</p> <pre><code>systemctl edit php-fpm\n</code></pre> <p>This will open an editor to create a drop-in file <code>/etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d/override.conf</code> which will override or extend the existing service file.</p> <p>Add the following lines to the file:</p> <pre><code>[Service]\nReadWritePaths=/etc/zabbix/web\n</code></pre> <p>Then exit the editor and reload the SystemD configuration:</p> <pre><code>systemctl daemon-reload\n</code></pre> How is SystemD preventing PHP-FPM from writing to /etc/zabbix/web? <p>On many modern Linux distributions, SystemD employs a security feature known as sandboxing to restrict the capabilities of services. This is done to enhance security by limiting the access of services to only the resources they need to function. By default, PHP-FPM may be restricted from writing to certain directories, including <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code>, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. This is enforced through SystemD's <code>ProtectSystem</code> and <code>ReadWritePaths</code> directives, which control the file system access of services.</p> Tip <p>Normally write access to <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> is only needed during the initial setup of the Zabbix frontend. After the setup is complete you can remove the drop-in file again to further harden the security of your system.</p> <p>First thing we have to do is alter the Nginx configuration file so that we don't use the standard config and serve the Zabbix frontend on port 80.</p> <p>Edit nginx config for Red Hat</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n</code></pre> <p>In this configuration file look for the following block that starts with <code>server {</code>:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> Tip <p>This block may be different depending on your distribution and Nginx version.</p> <p>Then, comment out the any <code>listen</code> and <code>server_name</code> directives to disable the default http server configuration. You can do this by adding a <code>#</code> at the beginning of each line, like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n    #listen 80;\n    #listen [::]:80;\n    #server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The Zabbix configuration file must now be modified to take over the default service on port 80 we just disabled. Open the following file for editing:</p> <p>Edit Zabbix config for nginx</p> <pre><code>sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/zabbix.conf\n</code></pre> <p>And alter the following lines:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n#       listen          8080;\n#       server_name     example.com;\n\n        root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n        index   index.php;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Remove the <code>#</code> in front of the first 2 lines and modify them with the correct port and domain for your front-end.</p> Tip <p>In case you don't have a domain you can replace <code>servername</code> with <code>_</code>  like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after the edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n        listen          80;\n        server_name     _;\n\n         root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n         index   index.php;\n</code></pre> <p>The web server and PHP-FPM service are now ready for activation and persistent startup.

Use port 3306 for MariaDB/MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database Name</code>: Specify the name of your database. In our case, it    is zabbix. If you are using PostgreSQL, you will also need to provide the    schema name, which is zabbix_server in our case.</li> <li><code>Enther the Database Schema</code>: Only for PostgreSQL users, enter the schema    name created for Zabbix server, which is <code>zabbix_server</code> in our case.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database User</code>: Input the database user created for the web    front-end, remember in our basic installation guide we created 2 users    <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>. One for the frontend and the other one for our    zabbix server so here we will use the user <code>zabbix-web</code>. Enter the    corresponding password for this user.</li> </ol> <p>Ensure that the <code>Database TLS encryption</code> option is not selected, and then click <code>Next step</code> to proceed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.8 Zabbix connections</p> <p>You're almost finished with the setup! The final steps involve:</p> <ol> <li><code>Assigning an Instance Name</code>: Choose a descriptive name for your Zabbix    instance.</li> <li><code>Selecting the Timezone</code>: Choose the timezone that matches your location or    your preferred time zone for the Zabbix interface.</li> <li><code>Setting the Default Time Format</code>: Select the default time format you prefer    to use.</li> <li>Encrypt connections from Web interface: I marked this box but you should    not. This box is to encrypt communications between Zabbix frontend and your    browser. We will cover this later. Once these settings are configured, you    can complete the setup and proceed with any final configuration steps as    needed.</li> </ol> Note <p>It's a good practice to set your Zabbix server to the UTC timezone, especially when managing systems across multiple timezones.

Keep in mind that the web server doesn't need to be installed on the same machine as the Zabbix server; they can be hosted on separate systems if desired.</p> <p>To install the Zabbix server components, run the following command:</p> <p>Install the zabbix server</p> <p>Red Hat <pre><code># For MySQL/MariaDB backend:\ndnf install zabbix-server-mysql\n# For PostgreSQL backend:\ndnf install zabbix-server-pgsql\n</code></pre></p> <p>SUSE <pre><code># For MySQL/MariaDB backend:\nzypper install zabbix-server-mysql\n# For PostgreSQL backend:\nzypper install zabbix-server-pgsql\n</code></pre></p> <p>Ubuntu <pre><code># For MySQL/MariaDB backend:\nsudo apt install zabbix-server-mysql\n# For PostgreSQL backend:\nsudo apt install zabbix-server-pgsql\n</code></pre></p> <p>After successfully installing the Zabbix server package, we need to configure the Zabbix server to connect to the database. This requires modifying the Zabbix server configuration file.</p> <p>The Zabbix server configuration file offers an option to include additional configuration files for custom parameters. For a production environment, it's often best to avoid altering the original configuration file directly. Instead, you can create and include separate configuration files for any additional or modified parameters. This approach ensures that your original configuration file remains untouched, which is particularly useful when performing upgrades or managing configurations with tools like Ansible, Puppet, or SaltStack.</p> <p>On SUSE 16 and later, this feature is already enabled and configured by default. (see also SUSE documentation). Hence, on SUSE systems, the Zabbix server configuration file is located at <code>/usr/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf</code>, and it is set up to include all <code>.conf</code> files from the <code>/etc/zabbix_server/zabbix_server.d/</code> directory.</p> <p>On other distributions, you may need to enable it manually:</p> <p>To enable this feature, ensure the next line exists and is not commented (with a <code>#</code> in front of it) in <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf</code>:</p> <pre><code># Include=/usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf.d/*.conf\nInclude=/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/*.conf\n</code></pre> <p>The path <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/</code> should already be created by the installed package, but ensure it really exists.</p> <p>Now we will create a custom configuration file <code>database.conf</code> in the <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/</code> directory that will hold our database connection settings:</p> <p>Add Zabbix database connection settings</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/database.conf\n</code></pre> <p>Add the following lines in the configuration file to match your database setup:</p> <pre><code># Zabbix database configuration\nDBHost=&lt;database-host&gt;\nDBName=&lt;database-name&gt;\nDBSchema=&lt;database-schema&gt;  # Only for PostgreSQL\nDBUser=&lt;database-user&gt;\nDBPassword=&lt;database-password&gt;\nDBPort=&lt;database-port&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>&lt;database-host&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-name&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-schema&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-user&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-password&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;database-port&gt;</code> with the appropriate values for your setup. This ensures that the Zabbix server can communicate with your database.</p> <p>Ensure that there is no <code>#</code> (comment symbol) in front of the configuration parameters, as Zabbix will treat lines beginning with <code>#</code> as comments, ignoring them during execution. Additionally, double-check for duplicate configuration lines; if there are multiple lines with the same parameter, Zabbix will use the value from the last occurrence.</p> <p>For our setup, the configuration will look like this:</p> <p>Example database.conf</p> <p>MariaDB/MySQL: <pre><code># MariaDB database configuration\nDBHost=&lt;ip or dns of your MariaDB server&gt;\nDBName=zabbix\nDBUser=zabbix-srv\nDBPassword=&lt;your super secret password&gt;\nDBPort=3306\n</code></pre></p> <p>PostgreSQL: <pre><code># PostgreSQL database configuration\nDBHost=&lt;ip or dns of your PostgreSQL server&gt;\nDBName=zabbix\nDBSchema=zabbix_server\nDBUser=zabbix-srv\nDBPassword=&lt;your super secret password&gt;\nDBPort=5432\n</code></pre></p> <p>In this example:</p> <ul> <li>DBHost refers to the host where your database is running (use localhost if   it's on the same machine).</li> <li>DBName is the name of the Zabbix database.</li> <li>DBSchema is the schema name used in PostgreSQL (only needed for PostgreSQL).</li> <li>DBUser is the database user.</li> <li>DBPassword is the password for the database user.</li> <li>DBPort is the port number on which your database server is listening (default   for MySQL/MariaDB is 3306 and PostgreSQL is 5432).</li> </ul> <p>Make sure the settings reflect your environment's database configuration.</p>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"fr/ch01-zabbix-components/zabbix-server/#starting-the-zabbix-server","title":"Starting the Zabbix server","text":"<p>With the Zabbix server configuration updated to connect to your database, you can now start and enable the Zabbix server service. Run the following command to enable the Zabbix server and ensure it starts automatically on boot:</p> Note <p>Before restarting the Zabbix server after modifying its configuration, it is considered best practice to validate the configuration to prevent potential issues.

In case of a proxy or system crash, all data is retained and will be sent to the Zabbix server as soon as the proxy is started again.</p> <p>This is slower due to database I/O but is highly reliable.</p> <code>memory</code> - Memory buffer <p>Data is stored in RAM and is not written to disk. This makes sure the data is sent to the Zabbix server as quickly as possible as there is no I/O wait time for the database involved. Downside is that when the proxy or the system crashes when the proxy still has data in the buffer, not yet received by the server, that data will be lost. Also when the RAM buffer overflows (<code>ProxyMemoryBufferSize</code>), possibly due to a sudden burst of incoming items or the Zabbix server being unavailable for some time, older data will be removed from the buffer before it is sent to the Zabbix server.</p> <code>hybrid</code> - Hybrid buffer (default for new installations since Zabbix 7.0) <p>Data is primarily stored in RAM but is automatically written to the database when the memory buffer is full, the data is too old or when the proxy is stopped. This makes sure that data is preserved in case the Zabbix server is unreachable for a longer period or when there are bursts of many incoming items and hereby balances speed and reliability.</p> Warning <p>In Proxies that where installed before <code>7.0</code> the data was first written to disk in the database and then sent to the <code>Zabbix server</code>. For these installations when we upgrade this remains the default behavior after upgrading to Zabbix 7.x or higher. It's now recommended for performance reasons to use the new setting <code>hybrid</code> and to define the <code>ProxyMemoryBufferSize</code>.</p> <p>Once you have made all the changes you need in the config file besides the ones we have covered, we only need to enable the service and start our proxy. Of course don't forget to open the firewall port <code>10051</code> on your Zabbix server side for the active proxy.</p> <p>Enable and start the proxy service</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl enable zabbix-proxy --now\n</code></pre> <p>If all goes well we can check the log file from our proxy and we will see that Zabbix has created the database by itself.</p> View Zabbix proxy logs <pre><code>localhost:~&gt; sudo tail -f /var/log/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.log`\n11134:20250519:152232.419 Starting Zabbix Proxy (active) [Zabbix proxy].

With the introduction of Zabbix 7.0, this behavior changed significantly. Now, configuration synchronization occurs much more frequently, every 10 seconds by default, but it's an incremental update. This means that instead of transferring the entire configuration, only the modified entities are synchronized, greatly improving efficiency and reducing network overhead.</p> <p>Upon initial proxy startup, a full configuration synchronization is still performed.

Since version 6, Zabbix has added protection for this kind of situations. When the Zabbix server history cache is full the history cache write access is being throttled: Zabbix server will stop accepting data from proxies when history cache usage reaches 80%. Instead those proxies will be put on a throttling list. This will continue until the cache usage falls down to 60%.

Zabbix supports several database options: MySQL/Percona, MariaDB, PostgreSQL (including TimescaleDB), and Oracle (up to Zabbix 7.0).</p> Oracle Database deprecation <p>Zabbix 7.0 marks the final release to offer support for Oracle Database. Consequently, systems running Zabbix 7.0 or any prior version must undertake a database migration to either PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a compatible fork such as MariaDB before upgrading to a later Zabbix release. This migration is a mandatory step to ensure continued functionality and compatibility with future Zabbix versions.</p> <p>All supported databases perform similarly under typical Zabbix workloads, and Zabbix treats them equally in terms of functionality. As such, the choice primarily depends on your or your team\u2019s familiarity with a particular database system. One notable exception is TimescaleDB, a PostgreSQL extension optimized for time-series data. This makes it especially well-suited for monitoring applications like Zabbix, which handle large volumes of timestamped data.</p> <p>In large-scale environments with high-frequency data collection, TimescaleDB can deliver significant performance benefits, including improved query speeds and built-in compression to reduce storage requirements. However, these advantages come with added complexity during installation and a few restrictions on historical data retention.</p> TimescaleDB installation <p>Given its advanced nature, TimescaleDB is not essential for most Zabbix users.

To administer the database, you will need to execute commands as the <code>postgres</code> user.</p> <p>First, create the Zabbix server database user (also referred to as a \"role\" in PostgreSQL):</p> <p>Create server users</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt zabbix-srv\nEnter password for new role: &lt;server-password&gt;\nEnter it again: &lt;server-password&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Next, create the Zabbix frontend user, which will be used to connect to the database:</p> <p>Create front-end user</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt zabbix-web\nEnter password for new role: &lt;frontend-password&gt;\nEnter it again: &lt;frontend-password&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now with the users created, the next step is to create the Zabbix database. Execute the following command to create the database <code>zabbix</code> with the owner set to <code>zabbix-srv</code> and the character encoding set to <code>Unicode</code> as required by Zabbix:</p> <p>Create DB</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createdb -E Unicode -T template0 -O zabbix-srv zabbix\n</code></pre> What is this 'template0'? <p>In PostgreSQL, <code>template0</code> is a default database template that serves as a pristine copy of the database system. When creating a new database using <code>template0</code>, it ensures that the new database starts with a clean slate, without any pre-existing objects or configurations that might be present in other templates. This is particularly useful when you want to create a database with specific settings or extensions without inheriting any unwanted elements from other templates.</p> <p>Once the database is created, you should verify the connection and ensure that the correct user session is active. To do this, log into the zabbix database using the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Login as user zabbix-srv</p> <pre><code>psql -d zabbix -U zabbix-srv\n</code></pre> <p>After logging in, run the following SQL query to confirm that both the <code>session_user</code> and <code>current_user</code> are set to <code>zabbix-srv</code>:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SELECT session_user, current_user;\n session_user | current_user\n--------------+--------------\n zabbix-srv   | zabbix-srv\n(1 row)\n</code></pre> <p>If the output matches, you are successfully connected to the database with the correct user.</p> <p>PostgreSQL differs significantly from MySQL or MariaDB in several aspects, and one of the key features that sets it apart is its use of schemas. Unlike MySQL, where databases are more standalone, PostgreSQL's schema system provides a structured, multi-user environment within a single database.</p> <p>Schemas act as logical containers within a database, enabling multiple users or applications to access and manage data independently without conflicts. This feature is especially valuable in environments where several users or applications need to interact with the same database server concurrently. Each user or application can have its own schema, preventing accidental interference with each other's data.</p> Note <p>PostgreSQL comes with a default schema, typically called <code>public</code>, but in general, it's a best practice to create custom schemas to better organize and separate database objects, especially in complex or multi-user environments.</p> <p>For more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the detailed guide at this URI, https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-schema/#schema which explains the benefits and use cases for schemas in PostgreSQL.</p> <p>To finalize the initial database setup for Zabbix, we need to configure schema permissions for both the <code>zabbix-srv</code> and <code>zabbix-web</code> users.</p> <p>First, we create a custom schema named <code>zabbix_server</code> and assign ownership to the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Create the db schema</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; CREATE SCHEMA zabbix_server AUTHORIZATION \"zabbix-srv\";\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we set the <code>search path</code> to <code>zabbix_server</code> schema so that it's the default for the current session:</p> <p>Set search path</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SET search_path TO \"zabbix_server\";\n</code></pre> Tip <p>If you prefer not to set the search path manually each time you log in as the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user, you can configure PostgreSQL to automatically use the desired search path. Run the following SQL command to set the default search path for the <code>zabbix-srv</code> role:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; ALTER ROLE \"zabbix-srv\" SET search_path = zabbix_server;\n</code></pre> <p>This command ensures that every time the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user connects to the database, the <code>search_path</code> is automatically set to <code>zabbix_server</code>.</p> <p>To confirm the schema setup, you can list the existing schemas:</p> <p>Verify schema access</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\dn\n          List of schemas\n     Name      |       Owner\n---------------+-------------------\n public        | pg_database_owner\n zabbix_server | zabbix-srv\n(2 rows)\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user has full access to the schema, but the <code>zabbix-web</code> user still needs appropriate permissions to connect and interact with the database. First, we grant <code>USAGE</code> privileges on the schema to allow <code>zabbix-web</code> to connect:</p> <p>Grant access to schema for user zabbix-web</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA zabbix_server TO \"zabbix-web\";\n</code></pre> <p>Now, the <code>zabbix-web</code> user has appropriate access to interact with the schema while maintaining security by limiting permissions to essential operations.</p> <p>If you are ready you can exit the database and return to your linux shell.</p> <p>Exit the database shell</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\q\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, your Zabbix database is ready, but before it can actually be used by Zabbix, we still need to populate the database with the necessary tables and initial data, but that will be covered in the next section when we install the Zabbix server.</p> <p>If you intent to install Zabbix server on a different machine than the one hosting the database you will need to open the host firewall to allow incoming connections to the database server.

You can think of it like an \"app store\" where you find and download software from a trusted source, in this case, the Zabbix repository. Many repositories are available, but it's important to only add those you trust. The safest practice is to stick to the repositories provided by your operating system and only add additional ones when you're sure they are both trusted and necessary.</p> <p>For our installation, the Zabbix repository is provided by the vendor itself, making it a trusted source. Another popular and safe repository for Red Hat-based systems is EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux), which is commonly used in enterprise environments. However, always exercise caution when adding new repositories to ensure system security and stability.</p>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"fr/ch01-zabbix-components/basic-installation/#installation-and-configuration-of-zabbix-server","title":"Installation and configuration of Zabbix server","text":"<p>Now that we've added the Zabbix repository with the necessary software, we are ready to install both the Zabbix server and the web server. Keep in mind that the web server doesn't need to be installed on the same machine as the Zabbix server; they can be hosted on separate systems if desired.</p> <p>To install the Zabbix server components, run the following command:</p> <p>Install the zabbix server</p> <p>Red Hat <pre><code># For MySQL/MariaDB backend:\ndnf install zabbix-server-mysql\n# For PostgreSQL backend:\ndnf install zabbix-server-pgsql\n</code></pre></p> <p>SUSE <pre><code># For MySQL/MariaDB backend:\nzypper install zabbix-server-mysql\n# For PostgreSQL backend:\nzypper install zabbix-server-pgsql\n</code></pre></p> <p>Ubuntu <pre><code># For MySQL/MariaDB backend:\nsudo apt install zabbix-server-mysql\n# For PostgreSQL backend:\nsudo apt install zabbix-server-pgsql\n</code></pre></p> <p>After successfully installing the Zabbix server package, we need to configure the Zabbix server to connect to the database. This requires modifying the Zabbix server configuration file.</p> <p>The Zabbix server configuration file offers an option to include additional configuration files for custom parameters. For a production environment, it's often best to avoid altering the original configuration file directly. Instead, you can create and include separate configuration files for any additional or modified parameters. This approach ensures that your original configuration file remains untouched, which is particularly useful when performing upgrades or managing configurations with tools like Ansible, Puppet, or SaltStack.</p> <p>On SUSE 16 and later, this feature is already enabled and configured by default. (see also SUSE documentation). Hence, on SUSE systems, the Zabbix server configuration file is located at <code>/usr/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf</code>, and it is set up to include all <code>.conf</code> files from the <code>/etc/zabbix_server/zabbix_server.d/</code> directory.</p> <p>On other distributions, you may need to enable it manually:</p> <p>To enable this feature, ensure the next line exists and is not commented (with a <code>#</code> in front of it) in <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf</code>:</p> <pre><code># Include=/usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf.d/*.conf\nInclude=/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/*.conf\n</code></pre> <p>The path <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/</code> should already be created by the installed package, but ensure it really exists.</p> <p>Now we will create a custom configuration file <code>database.conf</code> in the <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/</code> directory that will hold our database connection settings:</p> <p>Add Zabbix database connection settings</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/database.conf\n</code></pre> <p>Add the following lines in the configuration file to match your database setup:</p> <pre><code># Zabbix database configuration\nDBHost=&lt;database-host&gt;\nDBName=&lt;database-name&gt;\nDBSchema=&lt;database-schema&gt;  # Only for PostgreSQL\nDBUser=&lt;database-user&gt;\nDBPassword=&lt;database-password&gt;\nDBPort=&lt;database-port&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>&lt;database-host&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-name&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-schema&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-user&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-password&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;database-port&gt;</code> with the appropriate values for your setup.

By default PHP-FPM is not allowed by SELinux on SUSE to - map exec memory required for PHP JIT compilation, - connect to Zabbix server or - connect to the database server over TCP. We need to tell SELinux to allow all   this:</p> <p>SELinux: Allow PHP-FPM to map exec memory</p> <pre><code>setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1\n</code></pre> Tip <p>To troubleshoot SELinux issues, it is recommended to install the <code>setroubleshoot</code> package which will log any SELinux denials in the system log and provide suggestions on how to resolve them.</p> <p>Depending on your Linux distribution defaults, PHP-FPM may by default not be allowed by SystemD to write to the <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> directory required for the Zabbix frontend setup. To enable this we need to create a drop-in file to allow this:</p> <p>SystemD: Allow PHP-FPM to write to /etc/zabbix/web</p> <pre><code>systemctl edit php-fpm\n</code></pre> <p>This will open an editor to create a drop-in file <code>/etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d/override.conf</code> which will override or extend the existing service file.</p> <p>Add the following lines to the file:</p> <pre><code>[Service]\nReadWritePaths=/etc/zabbix/web\n</code></pre> <p>Then exit the editor and reload the SystemD configuration:</p> <pre><code>systemctl daemon-reload\n</code></pre> How is SystemD preventing PHP-FPM from writing to /etc/zabbix/web? <p>On many modern Linux distributions, SystemD employs a security feature known as sandboxing to restrict the capabilities of services. This is done to enhance security by limiting the access of services to only the resources they need to function. By default, PHP-FPM may be restricted from writing to certain directories, including <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code>, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. This is enforced through SystemD's <code>ProtectSystem</code> and <code>ReadWritePaths</code> directives, which control the file system access of services.</p> Tip <p>Normally write access to <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> is only needed during the initial setup of the Zabbix frontend. After the setup is complete you can remove the drop-in file again to further harden the security of your system.</p> <p>First thing we have to do is alter the Nginx configuration file so that we don't use the standard config and serve the Zabbix frontend on port 80.</p> <p>Edit nginx config for Red Hat</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n</code></pre> <p>In this configuration file look for the following block that starts with <code>server {</code>:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> Tip <p>This block may be different depending on your distribution and Nginx version.</p> <p>Then, comment out the any <code>listen</code> and <code>server_name</code> directives to disable the default http server configuration. You can do this by adding a <code>#</code> at the beginning of each line, like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n    #listen 80;\n    #listen [::]:80;\n    #server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The Zabbix configuration file must now be modified to take over the default service on port 80 we just disabled. Open the following file for editing:</p> <p>Edit Zabbix config for nginx</p> <pre><code>sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/zabbix.conf\n</code></pre> <p>And alter the following lines:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n#       listen          8080;\n#       server_name     example.com;\n\n        root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n        index   index.php;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Remove the <code>#</code> in front of the first 2 lines and modify them with the correct port and domain for your front-end.</p> Tip <p>In case you don't have a domain you can replace <code>servername</code> with <code>_</code>  like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after the edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n        listen          80;\n        server_name     _;\n\n         root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n         index   index.php;\n</code></pre> <p>The web server and PHP-FPM service are now ready for activation and persistent startup. Execute the following commands to enable and start them immediately:</p> <p>Restart the front-end services</p> <p>Red Hat / SUSE <pre><code>systemctl enable nginx php-fpm --now\n</code></pre></p> <p>Ubuntu <pre><code>sudo systemctl enable nginx php8.3-fpm --now\n</code></pre></p> <p>Let's verify if the service is properly started and enabled so that it survives our reboot next time.</p> <p>Check if the service is running</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl status nginx\n</code></pre> Example output <pre><code>localhost:~&gt; sudo systemctl status nginx\n\u25cf nginx.service - The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server\n      Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; preset: disabled)\n     Drop-In: /usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service.d\n              \u2514\u2500php-fpm.conf\n      Active: active (running) since Mon 2023-11-20 11:42:18 CET; 30min ago\n    Main PID: 1206 (nginx)\n       Tasks: 2 (limit: 12344)\n      Memory: 4.8M\n         CPU: 38ms\n      CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service\n              \u251c\u25001206 \"nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx\"\n              \u2514\u25001207 \"nginx: worker process\"\n\nNov 20 11:42:18 zabbix-srv systemd[1]: Starting The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server...\nNov 20 11:42:18 zabbix-srv nginx[1204]: nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok\nNov 20 11:42:18 zabbix-srv nginx[1204]: nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful\nNov 20 11:42:18 zabbix-srv systemd[1]: Started The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server.\n</code></pre> <p>With the service operational and configured for automatic startup, the final preparatory step involves adjusting the firewall to permit inbound HTTP traffic.

Er zijn veel verschillende manieren om een Zabbix server op te zetten. We behandelen de meest voorkomende opstellingen met MariaDB en PostgreSQL op RHEL- en SLES-gebaseerde distro's en Ubuntu.</p> <p>Voordat je begint met de installatie, is het belangrijk om de architectuur van Zabbix te begrijpen. De Zabbix server is modulair opgebouwd en bestaat uit drie hoofdcomponenten, die we in detail zullen bespreken.</p> <ul> <li>De Zabbix server</li> <li>De Zabbix webserver</li> <li>De Zabbix-database</li> </ul> <p>Aanmaken van DB-gebruikers</p> <p>In our setup we will create 2 DB users <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>.

This allows us to limit the permissions for every user to only what is strictly needed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.1 Zabbix basissplit installatie</p> <p>Al deze componenten kunnen ge\u00efnstalleerd worden op \u00e9\u00e9n server of verdeeld worden over drie afzonderlijke servers. De kern van het systeem is de Zabbix server, vaak het \"brein\" genoemd. Deze component is verantwoordelijk voor het verwerken van triggerberekeningen en het versturen van waarschuwingen. De database dient als opslag voor de configuratie van de Zabbix server en alle gegevens die het verzamelt. De webserver biedt de gebruikersinterface (front-end) voor interactie met het systeem. Het is belangrijk op te merken dat de Zabbix API deel uitmaakt van de front-end component, niet van de Zabbix server zelf.</p> <p>Deze componenten moeten naadloos samenwerken, zoals ge\u00efllustreerd in het bovenstaande diagram. De Zabbix server moet configuraties lezen en monitoringgegevens opslaan in de database, terwijl de front-end toegang nodig heeft om configuratiegegevens te lezen en te schrijven. Bovendien moet het front-end de status van de Zabbix server kunnen controleren en extra benodigde informatie ophalen om een soepele werking te garanderen.</p> <p>Voor onze opstelling gebruiken we twee virtuele machines (VM's): \u00e9\u00e9n VM host zowel de Zabbix server als de Zabbix web front-end, terwijl de tweede VM de Zabbix database host.</p> Note <p>It is perfectly possible to install all components on one single VM or every component on a separate VM. The reason why we split the DB in our example is because the database will probably be the first component giving you performance headaches. It is also the component that needs some extra attention when we split it from the other components, so for this reason we have chosen in this example to split the database  from the rest of the setup.</p> <p>We behandelen de volgende onderwerpen:</p> <ul> <li>Install our Database based on MariaDB.</li> <li>Install our Database based on PostgreSQL.</li> <li>Installing the Zabbix server.</li> <li>Install the frontend.</li> </ul>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"nl/ch01-zabbix-components/chapter/","title":"Zabbix componenten, basisfuncties en installatie","text":"<p>In dit hoofdstuk breiden we de basiskennis uit de \"Aan de slag\" sectie uit om een uitgebreide gids te bieden voor zowel beginners die Zabbix voor de eerste keer installeren als gevorderde gebruikers die hun installatie willen optimaliseren.

To administer the database, you will need to execute commands as the <code>postgres</code> user.</p> <p>First, create the Zabbix server database user (also referred to as a \"role\" in PostgreSQL):</p> <p>Create server users</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt zabbix-srv\nEnter password for new role: &lt;server-password&gt;\nEnter it again: &lt;server-password&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Next, create the Zabbix frontend user, which will be used to connect to the database:</p> <p>Create front-end user</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt zabbix-web\nEnter password for new role: &lt;frontend-password&gt;\nEnter it again: &lt;frontend-password&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now with the users created, the next step is to create the Zabbix database. Execute the following command to create the database <code>zabbix</code> with the owner set to <code>zabbix-srv</code> and the character encoding set to <code>Unicode</code> as required by Zabbix:</p> <p>Create DB</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createdb -E Unicode -T template0 -O zabbix-srv zabbix\n</code></pre> What is this 'template0'? <p>In PostgreSQL, <code>template0</code> is a default database template that serves as a pristine copy of the database system. When creating a new database using <code>template0</code>, it ensures that the new database starts with a clean slate, without any pre-existing objects or configurations that might be present in other templates. This is particularly useful when you want to create a database with specific settings or extensions without inheriting any unwanted elements from other templates.</p> <p>Once the database is created, you should verify the connection and ensure that the correct user session is active. To do this, log into the zabbix database using the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Login as user zabbix-srv</p> <pre><code>psql -d zabbix -U zabbix-srv\n</code></pre> <p>After logging in, run the following SQL query to confirm that both the <code>session_user</code> and <code>current_user</code> are set to <code>zabbix-srv</code>:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SELECT session_user, current_user;\n session_user | current_user\n--------------+--------------\n zabbix-srv   | zabbix-srv\n(1 row)\n</code></pre> <p>If the output matches, you are successfully connected to the database with the correct user.</p> <p>PostgreSQL differs significantly from MySQL or MariaDB in several aspects, and one of the key features that sets it apart is its use of schemas. Unlike MySQL, where databases are more standalone, PostgreSQL's schema system provides a structured, multi-user environment within a single database.</p> <p>Schemas act as logical containers within a database, enabling multiple users or applications to access and manage data independently without conflicts. This feature is especially valuable in environments where several users or applications need to interact with the same database server concurrently. Each user or application can have its own schema, preventing accidental interference with each other's data.</p> Note <p>PostgreSQL comes with a default schema, typically called <code>public</code>, but in general, it's a best practice to create custom schemas to better organize and separate database objects, especially in complex or multi-user environments.</p> <p>For more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the detailed guide at this URI, https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-schema/#schema which explains the benefits and use cases for schemas in PostgreSQL.</p> <p>To finalize the initial database setup for Zabbix, we need to configure schema permissions for both the <code>zabbix-srv</code> and <code>zabbix-web</code> users.</p> <p>First, we create a custom schema named <code>zabbix_server</code> and assign ownership to the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Create the db schema</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; CREATE SCHEMA zabbix_server AUTHORIZATION \"zabbix-srv\";\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we set the <code>search path</code> to <code>zabbix_server</code> schema so that it's the default for the current session:</p> <p>Set search path</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SET search_path TO \"zabbix_server\";\n</code></pre> Tip <p>If you prefer not to set the search path manually each time you log in as the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user, you can configure PostgreSQL to automatically use the desired search path. Run the following SQL command to set the default search path for the <code>zabbix-srv</code> role:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; ALTER ROLE \"zabbix-srv\" SET search_path = zabbix_server;\n</code></pre> <p>This command ensures that every time the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user connects to the database, the <code>search_path</code> is automatically set to <code>zabbix_server</code>.</p> <p>To confirm the schema setup, you can list the existing schemas:</p> <p>Verify schema access</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\dn\n          List of schemas\n     Name      |       Owner\n---------------+-------------------\n public        | pg_database_owner\n zabbix_server | zabbix-srv\n(2 rows)\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user has full access to the schema, but the <code>zabbix-web</code> user still needs appropriate permissions to connect and interact with the database. First, we grant <code>USAGE</code> privileges on the schema to allow <code>zabbix-web</code> to connect:</p> <p>Grant access to schema for user zabbix-web</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA zabbix_server TO \"zabbix-web\";\n</code></pre> <p>Now, the <code>zabbix-web</code> user has appropriate access to interact with the schema while maintaining security by limiting permissions to essential operations.</p> <p>If you are ready you can exit the database and return to your linux shell.</p> <p>Exit the database shell</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\q\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, your Zabbix database is ready, but before it can actually be used by Zabbix, we still need to populate the database with the necessary tables and initial data, but that will be covered in the next section when we install the Zabbix server.</p> <p>If you intent to install Zabbix server on a different machine than the one hosting the database you will need to open the host firewall to allow incoming connections to the database server.

Standaard mag PHP-FPM van SELinux op SUSE niet - map exec memory nodig voor PHP JIT compilatie, - verbinding maken met Zabbix-server of - verbinding maken met de databaseserver via TCP. We moeten SELinux vertellen   dit allemaal toe te staan:</p> <p>SELinux: PHP-FPM toestaan exec geheugen in kaart te brengen</p> <pre><code>setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1\n</code></pre> Tip <p>To troubleshoot SELinux issues, it is recommended to install the <code>setroubleshoot</code> package which will log any SELinux denials in the system log and provide suggestions on how to resolve them.</p> <p>Afhankelijk van de standaardinstellingen van je Linux-distributie, kan PHP-FPM standaard geen toestemming krijgen van SystemD om te schrijven naar de <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> directory die nodig is voor de Zabbix frontend setup. Om dit in te schakelen moeten we een drop-in bestand maken om dit toe te staan:</p> <p>SystemD: Allow PHP-FPM to write to /etc/zabbix/web</p> <pre><code>systemctl edit php-fpm\n</code></pre> <p>This will open an editor to create a drop-in file <code>/etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d/override.conf</code> which will override or extend the existing service file.</p> <p>Add the following lines to the file:</p> <pre><code>[Service]\nReadWritePaths=/etc/zabbix/web\n</code></pre> <p>Then exit the editor and reload the SystemD configuration:</p> <pre><code>systemctl daemon-reload\n</code></pre> How is SystemD preventing PHP-FPM from writing to /etc/zabbix/web? <p>On many modern Linux distributions, SystemD employs a security feature known as sandboxing to restrict the capabilities of services. This is done to enhance security by limiting the access of services to only the resources they need to function. By default, PHP-FPM may be restricted from writing to certain directories, including <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code>, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. This is enforced through SystemD's <code>ProtectSystem</code> and <code>ReadWritePaths</code> directives, which control the file system access of services.</p> Tip <p>Normally write access to <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> is only needed during the initial setup of the Zabbix frontend. After the setup is complete you can remove the drop-in file again to further harden the security of your system.</p> <p>First thing we have to do is alter the Nginx configuration file so that we don't use the standard config and serve the Zabbix frontend on port 80.</p> <p>Edit nginx config for Red Hat</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n</code></pre> <p>In this configuration file look for the following block that starts with <code>server {</code>:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> Tip <p>This block may be different depending on your distribution and Nginx version.</p> <p>Then, comment out the any <code>listen</code> and <code>server_name</code> directives to disable the default http server configuration. You can do this by adding a <code>#</code> at the beginning of each line, like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n    #listen 80;\n    #listen [::]:80;\n    #server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The Zabbix configuration file must now be modified to take over the default service on port 80 we just disabled. Open the following file for editing:</p> <p>Edit Zabbix config for nginx</p> <pre><code>sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/zabbix.conf\n</code></pre> <p>And alter the following lines:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n#       listen          8080;\n#       server_name     example.com;\n\n        root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n        index   index.php;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Verwijder de <code>#</code> voor de eerste 2 regels en pas ze aan met de juiste poort en domein voor je front-end.</p> Tip <p>In case you don't have a domain you can replace <code>servername</code> with <code>_</code>  like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after the edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n        listen          80;\n        server_name     _;\n\n         root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n         index   index.php;\n</code></pre> <p>The web server and PHP-FPM service are now ready for activation and persistent startup. Execute the following commands to enable and start them immediately:</p> <p>Restart the front-end services</p> <p>Red Hat / SUSE <pre><code>systemctl enable nginx php-fpm --now\n</code></pre></p> <p>Ubuntu <pre><code>sudo systemctl enable nginx php8.3-fpm --now\n</code></pre></p> <p>Let's verify if the service is properly started and enabled so that it survives our reboot next time.</p> <p>Check if the service is running</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl status nginx\n</code></pre> Example output <pre><code>localhost:~&gt; sudo systemctl status nginx\n\u25cf nginx.service - The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server\n      Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; preset: disabled)\n     Drop-In: /usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service.d\n              \u2514\u2500php-fpm.conf\n      Active: active (running) since Mon 2023-11-20 11:42:18 CET; 30min ago\n    Main PID: 1206 (nginx)\n       Tasks: 2 (limit: 12344)\n      Memory: 4.8M\n         CPU: 38ms\n      CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service\n              \u251c\u25001206 \"nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx\"\n              \u2514\u25001207 \"nginx: worker process\"\n\nNov 20 11:42:18 zabbix-srv systemd[1]: Starting The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server...\nNov 20 11:42:18 zabbix-srv nginx[1204]: nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok\nNov 20 11:42:18 zabbix-srv nginx[1204]: nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful\nNov 20 11:42:18 zabbix-srv systemd[1]: Started The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server.\n</code></pre> <p>With the service operational and configured for automatic startup, the final preparatory step involves adjusting the firewall to permit inbound HTTP traffic.

Use port 3306 for MariaDB/MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database Name</code>: Specify the name of your database. In our case, it    is zabbix. If you are using PostgreSQL, you will also need to provide the    schema name, which is zabbix_server in our case.</li> <li><code>Enther the Database Schema</code>: Only for PostgreSQL users, enter the schema    name created for Zabbix server, which is <code>zabbix_server</code> in our case.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database User</code>: Input the database user created for the web    front-end, remember in our basic installation guide we created 2 users    <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>. One for the frontend and the other one for our    zabbix server so here we will use the user <code>zabbix-web</code>. Enter the    corresponding password for this user.</li> </ol> <p>Ensure that the <code>Database TLS encryption</code> option is not selected, and then click <code>Next step</code> to proceed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.8 Zabbix connections</p> <p>You're almost finished with the setup! The final steps involve:</p> <ol> <li><code>Assigning an Instance Name</code>: Choose a descriptive name for your Zabbix    instance.</li> <li><code>Selecting the Timezone</code>: Choose the timezone that matches your location or    your preferred time zone for the Zabbix interface.</li> <li><code>Setting the Default Time Format</code>: Select the default time format you prefer    to use.</li> <li>Encrypt connections from Web interface: I marked this box but you should    not. This box is to encrypt communications between Zabbix frontend and your    browser. We will cover this later. Once these settings are configured, you    can complete the setup and proceed with any final configuration steps as    needed.</li> </ol> Note <p>It's a good practice to set your Zabbix server to the UTC timezone, especially when managing systems across multiple timezones. Using UTC helps ensure consistency in time-sensitive actions and events, as the server\u2019s timezone is often used for calculating and displaying time-related information.</p> <p></p> <p>1.9 Zabbix summary</p> <p>After clicking <code>Next step</code> again, you'll be taken to a page confirming that the configuration was successful.

Ons menu aan de linkerkant van het scherm heeft een kleine opknapbeurt gekregen. Laten we er eens in duiken. Als we de eerste keer inloggen in onze Zabbix setup met onze Admin-gebruiker zien we een pagina</p> <p>like this where we have our <code>main window</code> in green our <code>main menu</code> marked in red and our <code>links</code> marked in yellow.</p> <p></p> <p>2.1 Overview</p> <p>The main menu can be hidden by collapsing it completely or to reduce it to a set of small icons. When we click on the button with the 2 arrows to the left:</p> <p></p> <p>2.2 Collapse</p> <p>You will see that the menu collapses to a set of small icons. Pressing \"&gt;&gt;\" will bring the <code>main menu</code> back to it's original state.</p> <p>When you click on the icon that looks like a box with an arrow sticking out, next to the \"&lt;&lt;\" button will hide the <code>main menu</code> completely.</p> <p></p> <p>2.3 Hide</p> <p>To bring back our <code>main menu</code> is rather easy, we just look for the button on the left with three horizontal lines and click on it. This will show the <code>main menu</code> but it won't stay. When we click on the box with the arrow now pointing to the bottom right it will keep the <code>main menu</code> back in it's position.</p> <p>Yet another way to make the screen bigger that is quite useful for monitors in <code>NOK teams</code> for example is the <code>kiosk mode</code> button. This one however is located on the left side of your screen and looks like 4 arrows pointing to every corner of the screen. Pressing this button will remove all the menus and leave only the <code>main window</code> to focus on.</p> <p></p> <p>2.4 Expand</p> <p>When we want to leave the kiosk mode, the button will be changed to 2 arrows pointing to the inside of the screen. Pressing this button will revert us back to the original state.</p> <p></p> <p>2.5 Shrink</p> Tip <p>We can also enter and exit kiosk mode by making use of parameters in our Zabbix url: <code>/zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view&amp;kiosk=1</code> - activate kiosk mode or <code>/zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view&amp;kiosk=0</code> - activate normal mode.</p> Note <p>There are many other page parameters we can use. A full list can be found at https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/7.4/en/manual/web_interface/page_parameters Zabbix also has a global search menu that we can use to find hosts, host groups and templates.</p> <p>If we type in the search box the word <code>server</code> you will see that we get an overview of all <code>templates</code>, <code>host groups</code> and <code>hosts</code> with the name server in it. That's why this is called the <code>global search</code> box.</p> <p></p> <p>2.6 Global search</p> <p>This is our result after we looked for the word <code>server</code>. If you have a standard Zabbix setup your page should look more or less the same.</p> <p></p> <p>2.7 Global search result</p>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"nl/ch02-zabbix-installation/frontend/#the-main-menu-explained","title":"The main menu explained","text":"<p>It's important to know that we have seen so far our dashboard with the Admin user and that this user is a <code>Zabbix Super Admin</code> user.

Just be careful to not add the IP and DNS name for the same server as this can return double values.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Another important option is <code>Hostname</code>, especially on an Active proxy.   Remember in our frontend we gave our Active proxy the name <code>ProxyA</code>, so now   we have to fill in the exact same name here for hostname. Just like a Zabbix   agent in active mode Zabbix server will use the name as a unique   identifier.\\   For a passive proxy this option matters less, but for clarity it is best to   keep it the same: <code>ProxyP</code> in our case.</p> </li> <li> <p>On an Active proxy you may also consider setting <code>ProxyConfigFrequency</code> and   <code>DataSenderFrequency</code> to fine-tune communication with the Zabbix server, but   generally speaking, the defaults should suffice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other options to consider are <code>ProxyOfflineBuffer</code> and <code>ProxyLocalBuffer</code> to   make sure the proxy can keep up with Zabbix server outages and the amount of   monitored data it ingests.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The <code>general.conf</code> file should now look at least something like this:</p> /etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.d/general.conf <pre><code>ProxyMode=0\nServer=192.168.0.50\nHostname=ProxyA\n</code></pre> <p>To configure the database settings, create a dedicated configuration file at <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.d/database.conf</code>.

In case of a proxy or system crash, all data is retained and will be sent to the Zabbix server as soon as the proxy is started again.</p> <p>This is slower due to database I/O but is highly reliable.</p> <code>memory</code> - Memory buffer <p>Data is stored in RAM and is not written to disk. This makes sure the data is sent to the Zabbix server as quickly as possible as there is no I/O wait time for the database involved. Downside is that when the proxy or the system crashes when the proxy still has data in the buffer, not yet received by the server, that data will be lost. Also when the RAM buffer overflows (<code>ProxyMemoryBufferSize</code>), possibly due to a sudden burst of incoming items or the Zabbix server being unavailable for some time, older data will be removed from the buffer before it is sent to the Zabbix server.</p> <code>hybrid</code> - Hybrid buffer (default for new installations since Zabbix 7.0) <p>Data is primarily stored in RAM but is automatically written to the database when the memory buffer is full, the data is too old or when the proxy is stopped. This makes sure that data is preserved in case the Zabbix server is unreachable for a longer period or when there are bursts of many incoming items and hereby balances speed and reliability.</p> Warning <p>In Proxies that where installed before <code>7.0</code> the data was first written to disk in the database and then sent to the <code>Zabbix server</code>. For these installations when we upgrade this remains the default behavior after upgrading to Zabbix 7.x or higher. It's now recommended for performance reasons to use the new setting <code>hybrid</code> and to define the <code>ProxyMemoryBufferSize</code>.</p> <p>Once you have made all the changes you need in the config file besides the ones we have covered, we only need to enable the service and start our proxy.

Er zijn veel verschillende manieren om een Zabbix server op te zetten. We behandelen de meest voorkomende opstellingen met MariaDB en PostgreSQL op RHEL- en SLES-gebaseerde distro's en Ubuntu.</p> <p>Voordat je begint met de installatie, is het belangrijk om de architectuur van Zabbix te begrijpen. De Zabbix server is modulair opgebouwd en bestaat uit drie hoofdcomponenten, die we in detail zullen bespreken.</p> <ul> <li>De Zabbix server</li> <li>De Zabbix webserver</li> <li>The Zabbix database</li> </ul> <p>Creation of DB users</p> <p>In our setup we will create 2 DB users <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>. The  zabbix-web user will be used for the frontend to connect to our zabbix database. The zabbix-srv user will be used by our zabbix server to connect to the database. This allows us to limit the permissions for every user to only what is strictly needed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.1 Zabbix basic split installation</p> <p>All of these components can either be installed on a single server or distributed across three separate servers. The core of the system is the Zabbix server, often referred to as the \"brain.\" This component is responsible for processing trigger calculations and sending alerts. The database serves as the storage for the Zabbix server's configuration and all the data it collects. The web server provides the user interface (front-end) for interacting with the system. It is important to note that the Zabbix API is part of the front-end component, not the Zabbix server itself.</p> <p>These components must function together seamlessly, as illustrated in the diagram above. The Zabbix server must read configurations and store monitoring data in the database, while the front-end needs access to read and write configuration data. Furthermore, the front-end must be able to check the status of the Zabbix server and retrieve additional necessary information to ensure smooth operation.</p> <p>For our setup, we will be using two virtual machines (VMs): one VM will host both the Zabbix server and the Zabbix web front-end, while the second VM will host the Zabbix database.</p> Note <p>It is perfectly possible to install all components on one single VM or every component on a separate VM. The reason why we split the DB in our example is because the database will probably be the first component giving you performance headaches. It is also the component that needs some extra attention when we split it from the other components, so for this reason we have chosen in this example to split the database  from the rest of the setup.</p> <p>We behandelen de volgende onderwerpen:</p> <ul> <li>Install our Database based on MariaDB.</li> <li>Install our Database based on PostgreSQL.</li> <li>Installing the Zabbix server.</li> <li>Install the frontend.</li> </ul>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"nl/ch01-zabbix-components/basic-installation/#installing-the-zabbix-database","title":"Installing the Zabbix database","text":"","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"nl/ch01-zabbix-components/basic-installation/#choosing-a-database-backend-for-zabbix","title":"Choosing a Database Backend for Zabbix","text":"<p>A critical decision when managing Zabbix installations is selecting the database backend. Zabbix supports several database options: MySQL/Percona, MariaDB, PostgreSQL (including TimescaleDB), and Oracle (up to Zabbix 7.0).</p> Oracle Database deprecation <p>Zabbix 7.0 marks the final release to offer support for Oracle Database. Consequently, systems running Zabbix 7.0 or any prior version must undertake a database migration to either PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a compatible fork such as MariaDB before upgrading to a later Zabbix release. This migration is a mandatory step to ensure continued functionality and compatibility with future Zabbix versions.</p> <p>All supported databases perform similarly under typical Zabbix workloads, and Zabbix treats them equally in terms of functionality. As such, the choice primarily depends on your or your team\u2019s familiarity with a particular database system. One notable exception is TimescaleDB, a PostgreSQL extension optimized for time-series data. This makes it especially well-suited for monitoring applications like Zabbix, which handle large volumes of timestamped data.</p> <p>In large-scale environments with high-frequency data collection, TimescaleDB can deliver significant performance benefits, including improved query speeds and built-in compression to reduce storage requirements.

When creating a new database using <code>template0</code>, it ensures that the new database starts with a clean slate, without any pre-existing objects or configurations that might be present in other templates. This is particularly useful when you want to create a database with specific settings or extensions without inheriting any unwanted elements from other templates.</p> <p>Once the database is created, you should verify the connection and ensure that the correct user session is active. To do this, log into the zabbix database using the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Login as user zabbix-srv</p> <pre><code>psql -d zabbix -U zabbix-srv\n</code></pre> <p>After logging in, run the following SQL query to confirm that both the <code>session_user</code> and <code>current_user</code> are set to <code>zabbix-srv</code>:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SELECT session_user, current_user;\n session_user | current_user\n--------------+--------------\n zabbix-srv   | zabbix-srv\n(1 row)\n</code></pre> <p>If the output matches, you are successfully connected to the database with the correct user.</p> <p>PostgreSQL differs significantly from MySQL or MariaDB in several aspects, and one of the key features that sets it apart is its use of schemas. Unlike MySQL, where databases are more standalone, PostgreSQL's schema system provides a structured, multi-user environment within a single database.</p> <p>Schemas act as logical containers within a database, enabling multiple users or applications to access and manage data independently without conflicts. This feature is especially valuable in environments where several users or applications need to interact with the same database server concurrently. Each user or application can have its own schema, preventing accidental interference with each other's data.</p> Note <p>PostgreSQL comes with a default schema, typically called <code>public</code>, but in general, it's a best practice to create custom schemas to better organize and separate database objects, especially in complex or multi-user environments.</p> <p>For more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the detailed guide at this URI, https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-schema/#schema which explains the benefits and use cases for schemas in PostgreSQL.</p> <p>To finalize the initial database setup for Zabbix, we need to configure schema permissions for both the <code>zabbix-srv</code> and <code>zabbix-web</code> users.</p> <p>First, we create a custom schema named <code>zabbix_server</code> and assign ownership to the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Create the db schema</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; CREATE SCHEMA zabbix_server AUTHORIZATION \"zabbix-srv\";\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we set the <code>search path</code> to <code>zabbix_server</code> schema so that it's the default for the current session:</p> <p>Set search path</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SET search_path TO \"zabbix_server\";\n</code></pre> Tip <p>If you prefer not to set the search path manually each time you log in as the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user, you can configure PostgreSQL to automatically use the desired search path. Run the following SQL command to set the default search path for the <code>zabbix-srv</code> role:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; ALTER ROLE \"zabbix-srv\" SET search_path = zabbix_server;\n</code></pre> <p>This command ensures that every time the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user connects to the database, the <code>search_path</code> is automatically set to <code>zabbix_server</code>.</p> <p>To confirm the schema setup, you can list the existing schemas:</p> <p>Verify schema access</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\dn\n          List of schemas\n     Name      |       Owner\n---------------+-------------------\n public        | pg_database_owner\n zabbix_server | zabbix-srv\n(2 rows)\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user has full access to the schema, but the <code>zabbix-web</code> user still needs appropriate permissions to connect and interact with the database. First, we grant <code>USAGE</code> privileges on the schema to allow <code>zabbix-web</code> to connect:</p> <p>Grant access to schema for user zabbix-web</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA zabbix_server TO \"zabbix-web\";\n</code></pre> <p>Now, the <code>zabbix-web</code> user has appropriate access to interact with the schema while maintaining security by limiting permissions to essential operations.</p> <p>If you are ready you can exit the database and return to your linux shell.</p> <p>Exit the database shell</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\q\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, your Zabbix database is ready, but before it can actually be used by Zabbix, we still need to populate the database with the necessary tables and initial data, but that will be covered in the next section when we install the Zabbix server.</p> <p>If you intent to install Zabbix server on a different machine than the one hosting the database you will need to open the host firewall to allow incoming connections to the database server.

By default PHP-FPM is not allowed by SELinux on SUSE to - map exec memory required for PHP JIT compilation, - connect to Zabbix server or - connect to the database server over TCP. We need to tell SELinux to allow all   this:</p> <p>SELinux: Allow PHP-FPM to map exec memory</p> <pre><code>setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1\n</code></pre> Tip <p>To troubleshoot SELinux issues, it is recommended to install the <code>setroubleshoot</code> package which will log any SELinux denials in the system log and provide suggestions on how to resolve them.</p> <p>Depending on your Linux distribution defaults, PHP-FPM may by default not be allowed by SystemD to write to the <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> directory required for the Zabbix frontend setup. To enable this we need to create a drop-in file to allow this:</p> <p>SystemD: Allow PHP-FPM to write to /etc/zabbix/web</p> <pre><code>systemctl edit php-fpm\n</code></pre> <p>This will open an editor to create a drop-in file <code>/etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d/override.conf</code> which will override or extend the existing service file.</p> <p>Add the following lines to the file:</p> <pre><code>[Service]\nReadWritePaths=/etc/zabbix/web\n</code></pre> <p>Then exit the editor and reload the SystemD configuration:</p> <pre><code>systemctl daemon-reload\n</code></pre> How is SystemD preventing PHP-FPM from writing to /etc/zabbix/web? <p>On many modern Linux distributions, SystemD employs a security feature known as sandboxing to restrict the capabilities of services. This is done to enhance security by limiting the access of services to only the resources they need to function. By default, PHP-FPM may be restricted from writing to certain directories, including <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code>, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. This is enforced through SystemD's <code>ProtectSystem</code> and <code>ReadWritePaths</code> directives, which control the file system access of services.</p> Tip <p>Normally write access to <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> is only needed during the initial setup of the Zabbix frontend. After the setup is complete you can remove the drop-in file again to further harden the security of your system.</p> <p>First thing we have to do is alter the Nginx configuration file so that we don't use the standard config and serve the Zabbix frontend on port 80.</p> <p>Edit nginx config for Red Hat</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n</code></pre> <p>In this configuration file look for the following block that starts with <code>server {</code>:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> Tip <p>This block may be different depending on your distribution and Nginx version.</p> <p>Then, comment out the any <code>listen</code> and <code>server_name</code> directives to disable the default http server configuration. You can do this by adding a <code>#</code> at the beginning of each line, like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n    #listen 80;\n    #listen [::]:80;\n    #server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The Zabbix configuration file must now be modified to take over the default service on port 80 we just disabled. Open the following file for editing:</p> <p>Edit Zabbix config for nginx</p> <pre><code>sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/zabbix.conf\n</code></pre> <p>And alter the following lines:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n#       listen          8080;\n#       server_name     example.com;\n\n        root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n        index   index.php;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Remove the <code>#</code> in front of the first 2 lines and modify them with the correct port and domain for your front-end.</p> Tip <p>In case you don't have a domain you can replace <code>servername</code> with <code>_</code>  like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after the edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n        listen          80;\n        server_name     _;\n\n         root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n         index   index.php;\n</code></pre> <p>The web server and PHP-FPM service are now ready for activation and persistent startup.

Use port 3306 for MariaDB/MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database Name</code>: Specify the name of your database. In our case, it    is zabbix. If you are using PostgreSQL, you will also need to provide the    schema name, which is zabbix_server in our case.</li> <li><code>Enther the Database Schema</code>: Only for PostgreSQL users, enter the schema    name created for Zabbix server, which is <code>zabbix_server</code> in our case.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database User</code>: Input the database user created for the web    front-end, remember in our basic installation guide we created 2 users    <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>. One for the frontend and the other one for our    zabbix server so here we will use the user <code>zabbix-web</code>. Enter the    corresponding password for this user.</li> </ol> <p>Ensure that the <code>Database TLS encryption</code> option is not selected, and then click <code>Next step</code> to proceed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.8 Zabbix connections</p> <p>You're almost finished with the setup! The final steps involve:</p> <ol> <li><code>Assigning an Instance Name</code>: Choose a descriptive name for your Zabbix    instance.</li> <li><code>Selecting the Timezone</code>: Choose the timezone that matches your location or    your preferred time zone for the Zabbix interface.</li> <li><code>Setting the Default Time Format</code>: Select the default time format you prefer    to use.</li> <li>Encrypt connections from Web interface: I marked this box but you should    not. This box is to encrypt communications between Zabbix frontend and your    browser. We will cover this later. Once these settings are configured, you    can complete the setup and proceed with any final configuration steps as    needed.</li> </ol> Note <p>It's a good practice to set your Zabbix server to the UTC timezone, especially when managing systems across multiple timezones. Using UTC helps ensure consistency in time-sensitive actions and events, as the server\u2019s timezone is often used for calculating and displaying time-related information.</p> <p></p> <p>1.9 Zabbix summary</p> <p>After clicking <code>Next step</code> again, you'll be taken to a page confirming that the configuration was successful.

To administer the database, you will need to execute commands as the <code>postgres</code> user.</p> <p>First, create the Zabbix server database user (also referred to as a \"role\" in PostgreSQL):</p> <p>Create server users</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt zabbix-srv\nEnter password for new role: &lt;server-password&gt;\nEnter it again: &lt;server-password&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Next, create the Zabbix frontend user, which will be used to connect to the database:</p> <p>Create front-end user</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt zabbix-web\nEnter password for new role: &lt;frontend-password&gt;\nEnter it again: &lt;frontend-password&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Now with the users created, the next step is to create the Zabbix database. Execute the following command to create the database <code>zabbix</code> with the owner set to <code>zabbix-srv</code> and the character encoding set to <code>Unicode</code> as required by Zabbix:</p> <p>Create DB</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createdb -E Unicode -T template0 -O zabbix-srv zabbix\n</code></pre> What is this 'template0'? <p>In PostgreSQL, <code>template0</code> is a default database template that serves as a pristine copy of the database system. When creating a new database using <code>template0</code>, it ensures that the new database starts with a clean slate, without any pre-existing objects or configurations that might be present in other templates. This is particularly useful when you want to create a database with specific settings or extensions without inheriting any unwanted elements from other templates.</p> <p>Once the database is created, you should verify the connection and ensure that the correct user session is active. To do this, log into the zabbix database using the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Login as user zabbix-srv</p> <pre><code>psql -d zabbix -U zabbix-srv\n</code></pre> <p>After logging in, run the following SQL query to confirm that both the <code>session_user</code> and <code>current_user</code> are set to <code>zabbix-srv</code>:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SELECT session_user, current_user;\n session_user | current_user\n--------------+--------------\n zabbix-srv   | zabbix-srv\n(1 row)\n</code></pre> <p>If the output matches, you are successfully connected to the database with the correct user.</p> <p>PostgreSQL differs significantly from MySQL or MariaDB in several aspects, and one of the key features that sets it apart is its use of schemas. Unlike MySQL, where databases are more standalone, PostgreSQL's schema system provides a structured, multi-user environment within a single database.</p> <p>Schemas act as logical containers within a database, enabling multiple users or applications to access and manage data independently without conflicts. This feature is especially valuable in environments where several users or applications need to interact with the same database server concurrently. Each user or application can have its own schema, preventing accidental interference with each other's data.</p> Note <p>PostgreSQL comes with a default schema, typically called <code>public</code>, but in general, it's a best practice to create custom schemas to better organize and separate database objects, especially in complex or multi-user environments.</p> <p>For more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the detailed guide at this URI, https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-schema/#schema which explains the benefits and use cases for schemas in PostgreSQL.</p> <p>To finalize the initial database setup for Zabbix, we need to configure schema permissions for both the <code>zabbix-srv</code> and <code>zabbix-web</code> users.</p> <p>First, we create a custom schema named <code>zabbix_server</code> and assign ownership to the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Create the db schema</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; CREATE SCHEMA zabbix_server AUTHORIZATION \"zabbix-srv\";\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we set the <code>search path</code> to <code>zabbix_server</code> schema so that it's the default for the current session:</p> <p>Set search path</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SET search_path TO \"zabbix_server\";\n</code></pre> Tip <p>If you prefer not to set the search path manually each time you log in as the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user, you can configure PostgreSQL to automatically use the desired search path. Run the following SQL command to set the default search path for the <code>zabbix-srv</code> role:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; ALTER ROLE \"zabbix-srv\" SET search_path = zabbix_server;\n</code></pre> <p>This command ensures that every time the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user connects to the database, the <code>search_path</code> is automatically set to <code>zabbix_server</code>.</p> <p>To confirm the schema setup, you can list the existing schemas:</p> <p>Verify schema access</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\dn\n          List of schemas\n     Name      |       Owner\n---------------+-------------------\n public        | pg_database_owner\n zabbix_server | zabbix-srv\n(2 rows)\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user has full access to the schema, but the <code>zabbix-web</code> user still needs appropriate permissions to connect and interact with the database. First, we grant <code>USAGE</code> privileges on the schema to allow <code>zabbix-web</code> to connect:</p> <p>Grant access to schema for user zabbix-web</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA zabbix_server TO \"zabbix-web\";\n</code></pre> <p>Now, the <code>zabbix-web</code> user has appropriate access to interact with the schema while maintaining security by limiting permissions to essential operations.</p> <p>If you are ready you can exit the database and return to your linux shell.</p> <p>Exit the database shell</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\q\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, your Zabbix database is ready, but before it can actually be used by Zabbix, we still need to populate the database with the necessary tables and initial data, but that will be covered in the next section when we install the Zabbix server.</p> <p>If you intent to install Zabbix server on a different machine than the one hosting the database you will need to open the host firewall to allow incoming connections to the database server. By default, PostgreSQL listens on port 5432.</p> <p>Add firewall rules</p> <p>Red Hat / SUSE <pre><code>firewall-cmd --add-service=postgresql --permanent\nfirewall-cmd --reload\n</code></pre></p> <p>Ubuntu <pre><code>sudo ufw allow 5432/tcp\n</code></pre></p>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"pt_BR/ch01-zabbix-components/postgresql/#populate-the-zabbix-database","title":"Populate the Zabbix database","text":"<p>During the installation of the database software earlier, we created the necessary users, database and schema for Zabbix, however, Zabbix expects certain tables, schemas, images, and other elements to be present in the database.

By default PHP-FPM is not allowed by SELinux on SUSE to - map exec memory required for PHP JIT compilation, - connect to Zabbix server or - connect to the database server over TCP. We need to tell SELinux to allow all   this:</p> <p>SELinux: Allow PHP-FPM to map exec memory</p> <pre><code>setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1\n</code></pre> Tip <p>To troubleshoot SELinux issues, it is recommended to install the <code>setroubleshoot</code> package which will log any SELinux denials in the system log and provide suggestions on how to resolve them.</p> <p>Depending on your Linux distribution defaults, PHP-FPM may by default not be allowed by SystemD to write to the <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> directory required for the Zabbix frontend setup. To enable this we need to create a drop-in file to allow this:</p> <p>SystemD: Allow PHP-FPM to write to /etc/zabbix/web</p> <pre><code>systemctl edit php-fpm\n</code></pre> <p>This will open an editor to create a drop-in file <code>/etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d/override.conf</code> which will override or extend the existing service file.</p> <p>Add the following lines to the file:</p> <pre><code>[Service]\nReadWritePaths=/etc/zabbix/web\n</code></pre> <p>Then exit the editor and reload the SystemD configuration:</p> <pre><code>systemctl daemon-reload\n</code></pre> How is SystemD preventing PHP-FPM from writing to /etc/zabbix/web? <p>On many modern Linux distributions, SystemD employs a security feature known as sandboxing to restrict the capabilities of services. This is done to enhance security by limiting the access of services to only the resources they need to function. By default, PHP-FPM may be restricted from writing to certain directories, including <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code>, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. This is enforced through SystemD's <code>ProtectSystem</code> and <code>ReadWritePaths</code> directives, which control the file system access of services.</p> Tip <p>Normally write access to <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> is only needed during the initial setup of the Zabbix frontend. After the setup is complete you can remove the drop-in file again to further harden the security of your system.</p> <p>First thing we have to do is alter the Nginx configuration file so that we don't use the standard config and serve the Zabbix frontend on port 80.</p> <p>Edit nginx config for Red Hat</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n</code></pre> <p>In this configuration file look for the following block that starts with <code>server {</code>:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> Tip <p>This block may be different depending on your distribution and Nginx version.</p> <p>Then, comment out the any <code>listen</code> and <code>server_name</code> directives to disable the default http server configuration. You can do this by adding a <code>#</code> at the beginning of each line, like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n    #listen 80;\n    #listen [::]:80;\n    #server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The Zabbix configuration file must now be modified to take over the default service on port 80 we just disabled. Open the following file for editing:</p> <p>Edit Zabbix config for nginx</p> <pre><code>sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/zabbix.conf\n</code></pre> <p>And alter the following lines:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n#       listen          8080;\n#       server_name     example.com;\n\n        root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n        index   index.php;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Remove the <code>#</code> in front of the first 2 lines and modify them with the correct port and domain for your front-end.</p> Tip <p>In case you don't have a domain you can replace <code>servername</code> with <code>_</code>  like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after the edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n        listen          80;\n        server_name     _;\n\n         root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n         index   index.php;\n</code></pre> <p>The web server and PHP-FPM service are now ready for activation and persistent startup.

Zabbix is an open-source project that relies on community contributions for translations, so you can help improve it by contributing your own translations.</p> <p>Visit the translation page at https://translate.zabbix.com/ to assist with the translation efforts. Once your translation is complete and reviewed, it will be included in the next minor patch version of Zabbix. Your contributions help make Zabbix more accessible and improve the overall user experience for everyone.</p> <p>When you're satisfied with the available translations, click <code>Next</code>. You will then be taken to a screen to verify that all prerequisites are satisfied. If any prerequisites are not fulfilled, address those issues first. However, if everything is in order, you should be able to proceed by clicking <code>Next</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>1.7 Zabbix pre-requisites</p> <p>On the next page, you'll configure the database connection parameters:</p> <ol> <li><code>Select the Database Type</code>: Choose either MySQL or PostgreSQL depending on    your setup.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database Host</code>: Provide the IP address or DNS name of your    database server. Use port 3306 for MariaDB/MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database Name</code>: Specify the name of your database. In our case, it    is zabbix. If you are using PostgreSQL, you will also need to provide the    schema name, which is zabbix_server in our case.</li> <li><code>Enther the Database Schema</code>: Only for PostgreSQL users, enter the schema    name created for Zabbix server, which is <code>zabbix_server</code> in our case.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database User</code>: Input the database user created for the web    front-end, remember in our basic installation guide we created 2 users    <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>. One for the frontend and the other one for our    zabbix server so here we will use the user <code>zabbix-web</code>. Enter the    corresponding password for this user.</li> </ol> <p>Ensure that the <code>Database TLS encryption</code> option is not selected, and then click <code>Next step</code> to proceed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.8 Zabbix connections</p> <p>You're almost finished with the setup! The final steps involve:</p> <ol> <li><code>Assigning an Instance Name</code>: Choose a descriptive name for your Zabbix    instance.</li> <li><code>Selecting the Timezone</code>: Choose the timezone that matches your location or    your preferred time zone for the Zabbix interface.</li> <li><code>Setting the Default Time Format</code>: Select the default time format you prefer    to use.</li> <li>Encrypt connections from Web interface: I marked this box but you should    not. This box is to encrypt communications between Zabbix frontend and your    browser. We will cover this later. Once these settings are configured, you    can complete the setup and proceed with any final configuration steps as    needed.</li> </ol> Note <p>It's a good practice to set your Zabbix server to the UTC timezone, especially when managing systems across multiple timezones. Using UTC helps ensure consistency in time-sensitive actions and events, as the server\u2019s timezone is often used for calculating and displaying time-related information.</p> <p></p> <p>1.9 Zabbix summary</p> <p>After clicking <code>Next step</code> again, you'll be taken to a page confirming that the configuration was successful. Click <code>Finish</code> to complete the setup process.</p> <p></p> <p>1.10 Zabbix install</p> <p>We are now ready to login :</p> <p></p> <p>1.11 Zabbix login</p> <ul> <li>Login : Admin</li> <li>Password : zabbix</li> </ul> <p>This concludes our topic on setting up the Zabbix server. If you're interested in securing your front-end, I recommend checking out the topic Securing Zabbix for additional guidance and best practices.</p> Tip <p>If you are not able to save your configuration at the end, make sure you executed the SELinux related instructions or have SELinux disabled. Also check if the <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> directory is writable by the webservice user (usually <code>wwwrun</code> or <code>www</code>)</p>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"pt_BR/ch01-zabbix-components/zabbix-server/","title":"Installing the Zabbix server","text":"<p>Now that we've added the Zabbix repository with the necessary software, we are ready to install both the Zabbix server and the web server. Keep in mind that the web server doesn't need to be installed on the same machine as the Zabbix server; they can be hosted on separate systems if desired.</p> <p>To install the Zabbix server components, run the following command:</p> <p>Install the zabbix server</p> <p>Red Hat <pre><code># For MySQL/MariaDB backend:\ndnf install zabbix-server-mysql\n# For PostgreSQL backend:\ndnf install zabbix-server-pgsql\n</code></pre></p> <p>SUSE <pre><code># For MySQL/MariaDB backend:\nzypper install zabbix-server-mysql\n# For PostgreSQL backend:\nzypper install zabbix-server-pgsql\n</code></pre></p> <p>Ubuntu <pre><code># For MySQL/MariaDB backend:\nsudo apt install zabbix-server-mysql\n# For PostgreSQL backend:\nsudo apt install zabbix-server-pgsql\n</code></pre></p> <p>After successfully installing the Zabbix server package, we need to configure the Zabbix server to connect to the database. This requires modifying the Zabbix server configuration file.</p> <p>The Zabbix server configuration file offers an option to include additional configuration files for custom parameters. For a production environment, it's often best to avoid altering the original configuration file directly. Instead, you can create and include separate configuration files for any additional or modified parameters. This approach ensures that your original configuration file remains untouched, which is particularly useful when performing upgrades or managing configurations with tools like Ansible, Puppet, or SaltStack.</p> <p>On SUSE 16 and later, this feature is already enabled and configured by default. (see also SUSE documentation). Hence, on SUSE systems, the Zabbix server configuration file is located at <code>/usr/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf</code>, and it is set up to include all <code>.conf</code> files from the <code>/etc/zabbix_server/zabbix_server.d/</code> directory.</p> <p>On other distributions, you may need to enable it manually:</p> <p>To enable this feature, ensure the next line exists and is not commented (with a <code>#</code> in front of it) in <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf</code>:</p> <pre><code># Include=/usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf.d/*.conf\nInclude=/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/*.conf\n</code></pre> <p>The path <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/</code> should already be created by the installed package, but ensure it really exists.</p> <p>Now we will create a custom configuration file <code>database.conf</code> in the <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/</code> directory that will hold our database connection settings:</p> <p>Add Zabbix database connection settings</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/database.conf\n</code></pre> <p>Add the following lines in the configuration file to match your database setup:</p> <pre><code># Zabbix database configuration\nDBHost=&lt;database-host&gt;\nDBName=&lt;database-name&gt;\nDBSchema=&lt;database-schema&gt;  # Only for PostgreSQL\nDBUser=&lt;database-user&gt;\nDBPassword=&lt;database-password&gt;\nDBPort=&lt;database-port&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>&lt;database-host&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-name&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-schema&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-user&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-password&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;database-port&gt;</code> with the appropriate values for your setup. This ensures that the Zabbix server can communicate with your database.</p> <p>Ensure that there is no <code>#</code> (comment symbol) in front of the configuration parameters, as Zabbix will treat lines beginning with <code>#</code> as comments, ignoring them during execution. Additionally, double-check for duplicate configuration lines; if there are multiple lines with the same parameter, Zabbix will use the value from the last occurrence.</p> <p>For our setup, the configuration will look like this:</p> <p>Example database.conf</p> <p>MariaDB/MySQL: <pre><code># MariaDB database configuration\nDBHost=&lt;ip or dns of your MariaDB server&gt;\nDBName=zabbix\nDBUser=zabbix-srv\nDBPassword=&lt;your super secret password&gt;\nDBPort=3306\n</code></pre></p> <p>PostgreSQL: <pre><code># PostgreSQL database configuration\nDBHost=&lt;ip or dns of your PostgreSQL server&gt;\nDBName=zabbix\nDBSchema=zabbix_server\nDBUser=zabbix-srv\nDBPassword=&lt;your super secret password&gt;\nDBPort=5432\n</code></pre></p> <p>In this example:</p> <ul> <li>DBHost refers to the host where your database is running (use localhost if   it's on the same machine).</li> <li>DBName is the name of the Zabbix database.</li> <li>DBSchema is the schema name used in PostgreSQL (only needed for PostgreSQL).</li> <li>DBUser is the database user.</li> <li>DBPassword is the password for the database user.</li> <li>DBPort is the port number on which your database server is listening (default   for MySQL/MariaDB is 3306 and PostgreSQL is 5432).</li> </ul> <p>Make sure the settings reflect your environment's database configuration.</p>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"pt_BR/ch01-zabbix-components/zabbix-server/#starting-the-zabbix-server","title":"Starting the Zabbix server","text":"<p>With the Zabbix server configuration updated to connect to your database, you can now start and enable the Zabbix server service.

It's easy to   configure and effective just ensure that your Zabbix server maintains accurate   time settings to avoid authentication issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>Duo MFA: Integrates a more advanced, enterprise grade solution that provides   features like push notifications and customizable authentication methods. Duo   offers flexible and strong security, albeit requiring a bit more setup   (including HTTPS on the Zabbix WebUI).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Both MFA options elevate the login process by introducing an additional layer of validation. Administrators can apply MFA selectively by assigning it to specific user groups thus tailoring the security posture to organizational needs.</p> <p>Ultimately, enabling MFA not only enhances protection against unauthorized access but also fits within a broader strategy of robust authentication.

This file will contain the database connection parameters.</p> <p>For SQLite3 implementations, only the <code>DBName</code> parameter requires configuration, specifying the path to the database file. The Zabbix Proxy will automatically create and utilize this database file upon its initial startup.</p> /etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.d/database.conf <pre><code>DBName=/var/lib/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.db\n</code></pre> <p>You can choose any location for the database file, however you must make sure the directory exists and is writable by the Zabbix proxy process.</p> <p>In our example, we chose the default home-dir of the <code>zabbix</code>-user as configured by the Zabbix packages. You can check the home dir of the user on your host using the <code>getent passwd</code> command:</p> Check default homedir of user zabbix <pre><code>localhost:~&gt;getent passwd zabbix\nzabbix:x:476:476:Zabbix Monitoring System:/var/lib/zabbix:/sbin/nologin\n</code></pre> <p>Check if the directory exists with correct permissions and SELinux context:</p> Check existence of zabbix home-directory <pre><code>localhost:~&gt;ls -laZ /var/lib/zabbix\ntotal 0\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 zabbix zabbix unconfined_u:object_r:zabbix_var_lib_t:s0   0 Jan 10 20:01 .\ndrwxr-xr-x. 1 root   root   system_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0            364 Jan 10 20:05 ..\n</code></pre> <p>If the directory does not exist, is not owned by user <code>zabbix</code> or is missing the SELinux label <code>zabbix_var_lib_t</code>, then you will need to correct this:</p> <p>Create zabbix home-dir</p> <pre><code># Create the directory\nmkdir /var/lib/zabbix\n# Make user/group zabbix owner \nchown zabbix:zabbix /var/lib/zabbix\n# Restore SELinux context labels\nrestorecon -Rv /var/lib/zabbix\n</code></pre> Tip <p>See Advanced security: SELinux chapter for more details about SELinux and Zabbix.</p> MariaDB/MySQL or PostgreSQL as database for Zabbix proxy <p>If you chose to use MariaDB/MySQL or PostgreSQL, please refer to Installing the Zabbix server for the required database settings you will need to set in the <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.d/database.conf</code>-file.</p> Tip <p>A list of all configuration options can be found in the Zabbix documentation. https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/appendix/config/zabbix_proxy</p> <p>A notable configuration parameter that was added in <code>7.0</code> is <code>ProxyBufferMode</code> which determines how collected monitoring data is stored by the proxy before it is forwarded to the Zabbix server.</p> <p>Possible buffer modes:</p> <code>disk</code> - Disk buffer (default for existing installations prior to Zabbix 7.0) <p>All data is written to the Zabbix Proxy database immediately before it is sent to the Zabbix server. In case of a proxy or system crash, all data is retained and will be sent to the Zabbix server as soon as the proxy is started again.</p> <p>This is slower due to database I/O but is highly reliable.</p> <code>memory</code> - Memory buffer <p>Data is stored in RAM and is not written to disk. This makes sure the data is sent to the Zabbix server as quickly as possible as there is no I/O wait time for the database involved. Downside is that when the proxy or the system crashes when the proxy still has data in the buffer, not yet received by the server, that data will be lost. Also when the RAM buffer overflows (<code>ProxyMemoryBufferSize</code>), possibly due to a sudden burst of incoming items or the Zabbix server being unavailable for some time, older data will be removed from the buffer before it is sent to the Zabbix server.</p> <code>hybrid</code> - Hybrid buffer (default for new installations since Zabbix 7.0) <p>Data is primarily stored in RAM but is automatically written to the database when the memory buffer is full, the data is too old or when the proxy is stopped. This makes sure that data is preserved in case the Zabbix server is unreachable for a longer period or when there are bursts of many incoming items and hereby balances speed and reliability.</p> Warning <p>In Proxies that where installed before <code>7.0</code> the data was first written to disk in the database and then sent to the <code>Zabbix server</code>. For these installations when we upgrade this remains the default behavior after upgrading to Zabbix 7.x or higher. It's now recommended for performance reasons to use the new setting <code>hybrid</code> and to define the <code>ProxyMemoryBufferSize</code>.</p> <p>Once you have made all the changes you need in the config file besides the ones we have covered, we only need to enable the service and start our proxy. Of course don't forget to open the firewall port <code>10051</code> on your Zabbix server side for the active proxy.</p> <p>Enable and start the proxy service</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl enable zabbix-proxy --now\n</code></pre> <p>If all goes well we can check the log file from our proxy and we will see that Zabbix has created the database by itself.</p> View Zabbix proxy logs <pre><code>localhost:~&gt; sudo tail -f /var/log/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.log`\n11134:20250519:152232.419 Starting Zabbix Proxy (active) [Zabbix proxy].

With the introduction of Zabbix 7.0, this behavior changed significantly. Now, configuration synchronization occurs much more frequently, every 10 seconds by default, but it's an incremental update. This means that instead of transferring the entire configuration, only the modified entities are synchronized, greatly improving efficiency and reducing network overhead.</p> <p>Upon initial proxy startup, a full configuration synchronization is still performed. Subsequently, both the server and the proxy maintain a revision of the configuration. When a change is made on the server, only the differences, based on these revision numbers, are applied to the proxy's configuration, rather than a complete replacement of the entire configuration as in older versions.

Since version 6, Zabbix has added protection for this kind of situations. When the Zabbix server history cache is full the history cache write access is being throttled: Zabbix server will stop accepting data from proxies when history cache usage reaches 80%. Instead those proxies will be put on a throttling list. This will continue until the cache usage falls down to 60%.

There are many different ways to setup a Zabbix server. We will cover the most common setups with MariaDB and PostgreSQL on RHEL- and SLES-based distro's and Ubuntu.</p> <p>Antes de iniciar a instala\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e9 importante entender a arquitetura do Zabbix. O Zabbix Server \u00e9 estruturado de forma modular, composto por tr\u00eas componentes principais, que discutiremos em detalhes.</p> <ul> <li>O Zabbix Server</li> <li>O servidor web Zabbix (Frontend)</li> <li>O banco de dados do Zabbix</li> </ul> <p>Creation of DB users</p> <p>In our setup we will create 2 DB users <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>. The  zabbix-web user will be used for the frontend to connect to our zabbix database. The zabbix-srv user will be used by our zabbix server to connect to the database. This allows us to limit the permissions for every user to only what is strictly needed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.1 Instala\u00e7\u00e3o da divis\u00e3o b\u00e1sica do Zabbix</p> <p>Todos esses componentes podem ser instalados em um \u00fanico servidor ou distribu\u00eddos em tr\u00eas servidores separados. O n\u00facleo do sistema \u00e9 o Zabbix Server, geralmente chamado de \"c\u00e9rebro\". Esse componente \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel pelo processamento de c\u00e1lculos de acionamento e pelo envio de alertas. O banco de dados serve como armazenamento da configura\u00e7\u00e3o do servidor Zabbix e de todos os dados que ele coleta. O servidor Web fornece a interface do usu\u00e1rio (front-end) para interagir com o sistema. \u00c9 importante observar que a API do Zabbix faz parte do componente front-end, e n\u00e3o do pr\u00f3prio servidor Zabbix.</p> <p>Esses componentes devem funcionar juntos de forma integrada, conforme ilustrado no diagrama acima. O Zabbix Server deve ler as configura\u00e7\u00f5es e armazenar os dados de monitoramento no banco de dados, enquanto o front-end precisa ter acesso para ler e gravar os dados de configura\u00e7\u00e3o. Al\u00e9m disso, o front-end deve ser capaz de verificar o status do Zabbix Server e recuperar informa\u00e7\u00f5es adicionais necess\u00e1rias para garantir uma opera\u00e7\u00e3o tranquila.</p> <p>Para nossa configura\u00e7\u00e3o, usaremos duas m\u00e1quinas virtuais (VMs): uma VM hospedar\u00e1 o Zabbix Server e o Frontend, enquanto a segunda VM hospedar\u00e1 o banco de dados do Zabbix.</p> Note <p>It is perfectly possible to install all components on one single VM or every component on a separate VM. The reason why we split the DB in our example is because the database will probably be the first component giving you performance headaches. It is also the component that needs some extra attention when we split it from the other components, so for this reason we have chosen in this example to split the database  from the rest of the setup.</p> <p>Abordaremos os seguintes t\u00f3picos:</p> <ul> <li>Instale nosso banco de dados baseado no MariaDB.</li> <li>Instale nosso banco de dados baseado no PostgreSQL.</li> <li>Instalando o Zabbix Server.</li> <li>Instale o front-end.</li> </ul>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"pt_BR/ch01-zabbix-components/basic-installation/#installing-the-zabbix-database","title":"Installing the Zabbix database","text":"","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"pt_BR/ch01-zabbix-components/basic-installation/#choosing-a-database-backend-for-zabbix","title":"Choosing a Database Backend for Zabbix","text":"<p>A critical decision when managing Zabbix installations is selecting the database backend. Zabbix supports several database options: MySQL/Percona, MariaDB, PostgreSQL (including TimescaleDB), and Oracle (up to Zabbix 7.0).</p> Oracle Database deprecation <p>Zabbix 7.0 marks the final release to offer support for Oracle Database. Consequently, systems running Zabbix 7.0 or any prior version must undertake a database migration to either PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a compatible fork such as MariaDB before upgrading to a later Zabbix release. This migration is a mandatory step to ensure continued functionality and compatibility with future Zabbix versions.</p> <p>All supported databases perform similarly under typical Zabbix workloads, and Zabbix treats them equally in terms of functionality. As such, the choice primarily depends on your or your team\u2019s familiarity with a particular database system. One notable exception is TimescaleDB, a PostgreSQL extension optimized for time-series data. This makes it especially well-suited for monitoring applications like Zabbix, which handle large volumes of timestamped data.</p> <p>In large-scale environments with high-frequency data collection, TimescaleDB can deliver significant performance benefits, including improved query speeds and built-in compression to reduce storage requirements. However, these advantages come with added complexity during installation and a few restrictions on historical data retention.</p> TimescaleDB installation <p>Given its advanced nature, TimescaleDB is not essential for most Zabbix users. As such, its installation is beyond the scope of this chapter.

When creating a new database using <code>template0</code>, it ensures that the new database starts with a clean slate, without any pre-existing objects or configurations that might be present in other templates. This is particularly useful when you want to create a database with specific settings or extensions without inheriting any unwanted elements from other templates.</p> <p>Once the database is created, you should verify the connection and ensure that the correct user session is active.

Unlike MySQL, where databases are more standalone, PostgreSQL's schema system provides a structured, multi-user environment within a single database.</p> <p>Schemas act as logical containers within a database, enabling multiple users or applications to access and manage data independently without conflicts. This feature is especially valuable in environments where several users or applications need to interact with the same database server concurrently. Each user or application can have its own schema, preventing accidental interference with each other's data.</p> Note <p>PostgreSQL comes with a default schema, typically called <code>public</code>, but in general, it's a best practice to create custom schemas to better organize and separate database objects, especially in complex or multi-user environments.</p> <p>For more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the detailed guide at this URI, https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-schema/#schema which explains the benefits and use cases for schemas in PostgreSQL.</p> <p>To finalize the initial database setup for Zabbix, we need to configure schema permissions for both the <code>zabbix-srv</code> and <code>zabbix-web</code> users.</p> <p>Primeiro, criamos um esquema personalizado chamado <code>zabbix_server</code> e atribu\u00edmos a propriedade ao usu\u00e1rio <code>zabbix-srv</code>:</p> <p>Create the db schema</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; CREATE SCHEMA zabbix_server AUTHORIZATION \"zabbix-srv\";\n</code></pre> <p>Em seguida, definimos o caminho de pesquisa <code>` para</code>zabbix_server` schema para que seja o padr\u00e3o da sess\u00e3o atual:</p> <p>Definir caminho de pesquisa</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SET search_path TO \"zabbix_server\";\n</code></pre> Tip <p>If you prefer not to set the search path manually each time you log in as the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user, you can configure PostgreSQL to automatically use the desired search path. Run the following SQL command to set the default search path for the <code>zabbix-srv</code> role:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; ALTER ROLE \"zabbix-srv\" SET search_path = zabbix_server;\n</code></pre> <p>This command ensures that every time the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user connects to the database, the <code>search_path</code> is automatically set to <code>zabbix_server</code>.</p> <p>Para confirmar a configura\u00e7\u00e3o do esquema, voc\u00ea pode listar os esquemas existentes:</p> <p>Verify schema access</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\dn\n          List of schemas\n     Name      |       Owner\n---------------+-------------------\n public        | pg_database_owner\n zabbix_server | zabbix-srv\n(2 rows)\n</code></pre> <p>Neste ponto, o usu\u00e1rio <code>zabbix-srv</code> tem acesso total ao esquema, mas o usu\u00e1rio <code>zabbix-web</code> ainda precisa de permiss\u00f5es apropriadas para se conectar e interagir com o banco de dados. Primeiro, concedemos a <code>USAGE</code> privil\u00e9gios no esquema para permitir que <code>zabbix-web</code> se conecte:</p> <p>Conceder acesso ao esquema para o usu\u00e1rio zabbix-web</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA zabbix_server TO \"zabbix-web\";\n</code></pre> <p>Agora, o usu\u00e1rio <code>zabbix-web</code> tem acesso adequado para interagir com o esquema, mantendo a seguran\u00e7a ao limitar as permiss\u00f5es \u00e0s opera\u00e7\u00f5es essenciais.</p> <p>If you are ready you can exit the database and return to your linux shell.</p> <p>Exit the database shell</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\q\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, your Zabbix database is ready, but before it can actually be used by Zabbix, we still need to populate the database with the necessary tables and initial data, but that will be covered in the next section when we install the Zabbix server.</p> <p>If you intent to install Zabbix server on a different machine than the one hosting the database you will need to open the host firewall to allow incoming connections to the database server.

However, this change is not persistent across reboots. To make it permanent, you need to modify the SELinux configuration file located at <code>/etc/selinux/config</code>. Open the file and replace enforcing with <code>permissive</code>.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can achieve the same result more easily by running the following command:</p> <p>Desativar o SeLinux permanentemente</p> <p>Red Hat <pre><code>sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/g' /etc/selinux/config\n</code></pre></p> <p>This line will alter the configuration file for you. So when we run <code>sestatus</code> again we will see that we are in <code>permissive</code> mode and that our configuration file is also in permissive mode.</p> <p>Verificar novamente o status do selinux</p> <pre><code>~# sestatus\nSELinux status:                 enabled\nSELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux\nSELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux\nLoaded policy name:             targeted\nCurrent mode:                   permissive\nMode from config file:          permissive\nPolicy MLS status:              enabled\nPolicy deny_unknown status:     allowed\nMemory protection checking:     actual (secure)\nMax kernel policy version:      33\n</code></pre>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"pt_BR/ch01-zabbix-components/basic-installation/#install-the-zabbix-repository","title":"Install the Zabbix repository","text":"<p>From the Zabbix Download page https://www.zabbix.com/download, select the appropriate Zabbix version you wish to install.

The safest practice is to stick to the repositories provided by your operating system and only add additional ones when you're sure they are both trusted and necessary.</p> <p>For our installation, the Zabbix repository is provided by the vendor itself, making it a trusted source.

This requires modifying the Zabbix server configuration file.</p> <p>The Zabbix server configuration file offers an option to include additional configuration files for custom parameters. For a production environment, it's often best to avoid altering the original configuration file directly. Instead, you can create and include separate configuration files for any additional or modified parameters. This approach ensures that your original configuration file remains untouched, which is particularly useful when performing upgrades or managing configurations with tools like Ansible, Puppet, or SaltStack.</p> <p>On SUSE 16 and later, this feature is already enabled and configured by default. (see also SUSE documentation). Hence, on SUSE systems, the Zabbix server configuration file is located at <code>/usr/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf</code>, and it is set up to include all <code>.conf</code> files from the <code>/etc/zabbix_server/zabbix_server.d/</code> directory.</p> <p>On other distributions, you may need to enable it manually:</p> <p>To enable this feature, ensure the next line exists and is not commented (with a <code>#</code> in front of it) in <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf</code>:</p> <pre><code># Include=/usr/local/etc/zabbix_server.conf.d/*.conf\nInclude=/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/*.conf\n</code></pre> <p>The path <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/</code> should already be created by the installed package, but ensure it really exists.</p> <p>Now we will create a custom configuration file <code>database.conf</code> in the <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/</code> directory that will hold our database connection settings:</p> <p>Add Zabbix database connection settings</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.d/database.conf\n</code></pre> <p>Add the following lines in the configuration file to match your database setup:</p> <pre><code># Zabbix database configuration\nDBHost=&lt;database-host&gt;\nDBName=&lt;database-name&gt;\nDBSchema=&lt;database-schema&gt;  # Only for PostgreSQL\nDBUser=&lt;database-user&gt;\nDBPassword=&lt;database-password&gt;\nDBPort=&lt;database-port&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Replace <code>&lt;database-host&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-name&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-schema&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-user&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;database-password&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;database-port&gt;</code> with the appropriate values for your setup.

By default PHP-FPM is not allowed by SELinux on SUSE to - map exec memory required for PHP JIT compilation, - connect to Zabbix server or - connect to the database server over TCP. We need to tell SELinux to allow all   this:</p> <p>SELinux: Allow PHP-FPM to map exec memory</p> <pre><code>setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1\n</code></pre> Tip <p>To troubleshoot SELinux issues, it is recommended to install the <code>setroubleshoot</code> package which will log any SELinux denials in the system log and provide suggestions on how to resolve them.</p> <p>Depending on your Linux distribution defaults, PHP-FPM may by default not be allowed by SystemD to write to the <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> directory required for the Zabbix frontend setup. To enable this we need to create a drop-in file to allow this:</p> <p>SystemD: Allow PHP-FPM to write to /etc/zabbix/web</p> <pre><code>systemctl edit php-fpm\n</code></pre> <p>This will open an editor to create a drop-in file <code>/etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d/override.conf</code> which will override or extend the existing service file.</p> <p>Add the following lines to the file:</p> <pre><code>[Service]\nReadWritePaths=/etc/zabbix/web\n</code></pre> <p>Then exit the editor and reload the SystemD configuration:</p> <pre><code>systemctl daemon-reload\n</code></pre> How is SystemD preventing PHP-FPM from writing to /etc/zabbix/web? <p>On many modern Linux distributions, SystemD employs a security feature known as sandboxing to restrict the capabilities of services. This is done to enhance security by limiting the access of services to only the resources they need to function. By default, PHP-FPM may be restricted from writing to certain directories, including <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code>, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. This is enforced through SystemD's <code>ProtectSystem</code> and <code>ReadWritePaths</code> directives, which control the file system access of services.</p> Tip <p>Normally write access to <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> is only needed during the initial setup of the Zabbix frontend. After the setup is complete you can remove the drop-in file again to further harden the security of your system.</p> <p>First thing we have to do is alter the Nginx configuration file so that we don't use the standard config and serve the Zabbix frontend on port 80.</p> <p>Edit nginx config for Red Hat</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n</code></pre> <p>In this configuration file look for the following block that starts with <code>server {</code>:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> Tip <p>This block may be different depending on your distribution and Nginx version.</p> <p>Then, comment out the any <code>listen</code> and <code>server_name</code> directives to disable the default http server configuration. You can do this by adding a <code>#</code> at the beginning of each line, like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n    #listen 80;\n    #listen [::]:80;\n    #server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The Zabbix configuration file must now be modified to take over the default service on port 80 we just disabled.

Zabbix is an open-source project that relies on community contributions for translations, so you can help improve it by contributing your own translations.</p> <p>Visit the translation page at https://translate.zabbix.com/ to assist with the translation efforts. Once your translation is complete and reviewed, it will be included in the next minor patch version of Zabbix. Your contributions help make Zabbix more accessible and improve the overall user experience for everyone.</p> <p>When you're satisfied with the available translations, click <code>Next</code>. You will then be taken to a screen to verify that all prerequisites are satisfied. If any prerequisites are not fulfilled, address those issues first. However, if everything is in order, you should be able to proceed by clicking <code>Next</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>1.7 Zabbix pre-requisites</p> <p>On the next page, you'll configure the database connection parameters:</p> <ol> <li><code>Select the Database Type</code>: Choose either MySQL or PostgreSQL depending on    your setup.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database Host</code>: Provide the IP address or DNS name of your    database server. Use port 3306 for MariaDB/MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database Name</code>: Specify the name of your database. In our case, it    is zabbix. If you are using PostgreSQL, you will also need to provide the    schema name, which is zabbix_server in our case.</li> <li><code>Enther the Database Schema</code>: Only for PostgreSQL users, enter the schema    name created for Zabbix server, which is <code>zabbix_server</code> in our case.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database User</code>: Input the database user created for the web    front-end, remember in our basic installation guide we created 2 users    <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>. One for the frontend and the other one for our    zabbix server so here we will use the user <code>zabbix-web</code>. Enter the    corresponding password for this user.</li> </ol> <p>Ensure that the <code>Database TLS encryption</code> option is not selected, and then click <code>Next step</code> to proceed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.8 Zabbix connections</p> <p>You're almost finished with the setup! The final steps involve:</p> <ol> <li><code>Assigning an Instance Name</code>: Choose a descriptive name for your Zabbix    instance.</li> <li><code>Selecting the Timezone</code>: Choose the timezone that matches your location or    your preferred time zone for the Zabbix interface.</li> <li><code>Setting the Default Time Format</code>: Select the default time format you prefer    to use.</li> <li>Encrypt connections from Web interface: I marked this box but you should    not. This box is to encrypt communications between Zabbix frontend and your    browser. We will cover this later. Once these settings are configured, you    can complete the setup and proceed with any final configuration steps as    needed.</li> </ol> Note <p>It's a good practice to set your Zabbix server to the UTC timezone, especially when managing systems across multiple timezones. Using UTC helps ensure consistency in time-sensitive actions and events, as the server\u2019s timezone is often used for calculating and displaying time-related information.</p> <p></p> <p>1.9 Zabbix summary</p> <p>After clicking <code>Next step</code> again, you'll be taken to a page confirming that the configuration was successful. Click <code>Finish</code> to complete the setup process.</p> <p></p> <p>1.10 Zabbix install</p> <p>We are now ready to login :</p> <p></p> <p>1.11 Zabbix login</p> <ul> <li>Login : Admin</li> <li>Password : zabbix</li> </ul> <p>This concludes our topic on setting up the Zabbix server. If you're interested in securing your front-end, I recommend checking out the topic Securing Zabbix for additional guidance and best practices.</p> Note <p>If you are not able to safe your configuration at the end make sure SeLinux is disabled. It is possible that it will block access to certain files or even the database.</p>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"pt_BR/ch01-zabbix-components/basic-installation/#conclusao","title":"Conclus\u00e3o","text":"<p>With this, we conclude our journey through setting up Zabbix and configuring it with MySQL or PostgreSQL on RHEL or SUSE-based systems or Ubuntu.

If your distribution does not use Firewalld, refer to your OS documentation for the appropriate firewall configuration steps. Ubuntu makes use of UFW which is merely a frontend for iptables.</p> <p>During the Zabbix installation in the next chapters, we will need to open specific ports in the firewall to allow communication between Zabbix components.</p> <p>Alternatively to just opening ports, as we will do in the next chapters, you can also choose to define dedicated firewall zones for specific use cases. This approach enhances security by isolating services and restricting access based on trust levels. For example...</p> <p>Create a firewalld zone for database access</p> <pre><code>firewall-cmd --new-zone=db_zone --permanent\n</code></pre> <p>\u0412\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u043e\u043d\u044b, \u0432\u044b\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0432 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0443\u044e \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443:</p> <p>Verify the zone creation</p> <pre><code>localhost:~ # firewall-cmd --get-zones\nblock dmz drop external home internal nm-shared db_zone public trusted work\n</code></pre> <p>Using zones in firewalld to configure firewall rules provides several advantages in terms of security, flexibility, and ease of management.

If the main one breaks, the backup jumps in right away by taking over the IP.</p> <p>Keepalived is a minimal type of clustering software that enables the use of a (VIP) for frontend services, ensuring seamless failover and service continuity.</p> <p>High Availability on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)</p> <p>On SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), Keepalived is not included in the default subscription hence unavailable in the default repositories.</p> <p>To be able to install and use Keepalived on SLES in a supported way, you will need to obtain the additional 'SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension' subscription (SLE HA). This subscription provides access to the necessary packages and updates required for Keepalived and other high availability components. After obtaining the subscription, you can enable the appropriate repositories and proceed with the installation of Keepalived as outlined in this guide:</p> <p><pre><code>SUSEConnect -p sle-ha/16/x86_64 -r ADDITIONAL_REGCODE\n</code></pre> Where <code>ADDITIONAL_REGCODE</code> is the registration code provided with your 'SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension' subscription.</p>","tags":["expert"]},{"location":"ru/ch01-zabbix-components/ha-setup/#setting-up-keepalived","title":"Setting up keepalived","text":"<p>On all Servers that will host the Zabbix fronted we have to install keepalived.

While the configurations will be similar, each server requires slight adjustments. We will begin with Server 1. To edit the Keepalived configuration file, use the following command:</p> <p>Edit the keepalived config</p> <pre><code>sudo vi /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf\n</code></pre> <p>If the file contains any existing content, it should be cleared and replaced with the following lines:</p> <pre><code>vrrp_track_process track_nginx {\n    process nginx\n    weight 10\n}\n\nvrrp_instance VI_1 {\n    state MASTER\n    interface enp0s1\n    virtual_router_id 51\n    priority 244\n    advert_int 1\n    authentication {\n        auth_type PASS\n        auth_pass 12345\n    }\n    virtual_ipaddress {\n        xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n    }\n    track_process {\n         track_nginx\n      }\n}\n</code></pre> Warning <p>Replace <code>enp0s1</code> with the interface name of your machine and replace the <code>password</code> with something secure. For the <code>virtual_ipaddress</code> use a free IP from your network. This will be used as our VIP.</p> <p>We can now do the same modification on our second or any subsequent Zabbix server. Delete again everything in the <code>/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf</code> file like we did before and replace it with following lines:</p> <pre><code>vrrp_track_process track_nginx {\n      process nginx\n      weight 10\n}\n\nvrrp_instance VI_1 {\n    state BACKUP\n    interface enp0s1\n    virtual_router_id 51\n    priority 243\n    advert_int 1\n    authentication {\n        auth_type PASS\n        auth_pass 12345\n    }\n    virtual_ipaddress {\n       xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\n    }\n    track_process {\n         track_nginx\n      }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Just as with our 1st Zabbix server, replace <code>enp0s1</code> with the interface name of your machine and replace the <code>password</code> with your password and fill in the <code>virtual_ipaddress</code> as done before.</p> <p>Make sure that the firewall allows Keepalived traffic on all servers. The VRRP protocol is different than the standard IP protocol and uses multicast address <code>224.0.0.18</code>. Therefore, we need to explicitly allow this traffic through the firewall.

There are many different ways to setup a Zabbix server. We will cover the most common setups with MariaDB and PostgreSQL on RHEL- and SLES-based distro's and Ubuntu.</p> <p>Before beginning the installation, it is important to understand the architecture of Zabbix. The Zabbix server is structured in a modular fashion, composed of three main components, which we will discuss in detail.</p> <ul> <li>The Zabbix server</li> <li>The Zabbix web server</li> <li>The Zabbix database</li> </ul> <p>Creation of DB users</p> <p>In our setup we will create 2 DB users <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>. The  zabbix-web user will be used for the frontend to connect to our zabbix database. The zabbix-srv user will be used by our zabbix server to connect to the database. This allows us to limit the permissions for every user to only what is strictly needed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.1 Zabbix basic split installation</p> <p>All of these components can either be installed on a single server or distributed across three separate servers. The core of the system is the Zabbix server, often referred to as the \"brain.\" This component is responsible for processing trigger calculations and sending alerts. The database serves as the storage for the Zabbix server's configuration and all the data it collects. The web server provides the user interface (front-end) for interacting with the system. It is important to note that the Zabbix API is part of the front-end component, not the Zabbix server itself.</p> <p>These components must function together seamlessly, as illustrated in the diagram above. The Zabbix server must read configurations and store monitoring data in the database, while the front-end needs access to read and write configuration data. Furthermore, the front-end must be able to check the status of the Zabbix server and retrieve additional necessary information to ensure smooth operation.</p> <p>For our setup, we will be using two virtual machines (VMs): one VM will host both the Zabbix server and the Zabbix web front-end, while the second VM will host the Zabbix database.</p> Note <p>It is perfectly possible to install all components on one single VM or every component on a separate VM. The reason why we split the DB in our example is because the database will probably be the first component giving you performance headaches. It is also the component that needs some extra attention when we split it from the other components, so for this reason we have chosen in this example to split the database  from the rest of the setup.</p> <p>We will cover the following topics:</p> <ul> <li>Install our Database based on MariaDB.</li> <li>Install our Database based on PostgreSQL.</li> <li>Installing the Zabbix server.</li> <li>Install the frontend.</li> </ul>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"ru/ch01-zabbix-components/basic-installation/#installing-the-zabbix-database","title":"Installing the Zabbix database","text":"","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"ru/ch01-zabbix-components/basic-installation/#choosing-a-database-backend-for-zabbix","title":"Choosing a Database Backend for Zabbix","text":"<p>A critical decision when managing Zabbix installations is selecting the database backend. Zabbix supports several database options: MySQL/Percona, MariaDB, PostgreSQL (including TimescaleDB), and Oracle (up to Zabbix 7.0).</p> Oracle Database deprecation <p>Zabbix 7.0 marks the final release to offer support for Oracle Database. Consequently, systems running Zabbix 7.0 or any prior version must undertake a database migration to either PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a compatible fork such as MariaDB before upgrading to a later Zabbix release. This migration is a mandatory step to ensure continued functionality and compatibility with future Zabbix versions.</p> <p>All supported databases perform similarly under typical Zabbix workloads, and Zabbix treats them equally in terms of functionality. As such, the choice primarily depends on your or your team\u2019s familiarity with a particular database system. One notable exception is TimescaleDB, a PostgreSQL extension optimized for time-series data. This makes it especially well-suited for monitoring applications like Zabbix, which handle large volumes of timestamped data.</p> <p>In large-scale environments with high-frequency data collection, TimescaleDB can deliver significant performance benefits, including improved query speeds and built-in compression to reduce storage requirements. However, these advantages come with added complexity during installation and a few restrictions on historical data retention.</p> TimescaleDB installation <p>Given its advanced nature, TimescaleDB is not essential for most Zabbix users. As such, its installation is beyond the scope of this chapter.

When creating a new database using <code>template0</code>, it ensures that the new database starts with a clean slate, without any pre-existing objects or configurations that might be present in other templates. This is particularly useful when you want to create a database with specific settings or extensions without inheriting any unwanted elements from other templates.</p> <p>Once the database is created, you should verify the connection and ensure that the correct user session is active. To do this, log into the zabbix database using the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Login as user zabbix-srv</p> <pre><code>psql -d zabbix -U zabbix-srv\n</code></pre> <p>After logging in, run the following SQL query to confirm that both the <code>session_user</code> and <code>current_user</code> are set to <code>zabbix-srv</code>:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SELECT session_user, current_user;\n session_user | current_user\n--------------+--------------\n zabbix-srv   | zabbix-srv\n(1 row)\n</code></pre> <p>If the output matches, you are successfully connected to the database with the correct user.</p> <p>PostgreSQL differs significantly from MySQL or MariaDB in several aspects, and one of the key features that sets it apart is its use of schemas. Unlike MySQL, where databases are more standalone, PostgreSQL's schema system provides a structured, multi-user environment within a single database.</p> <p>Schemas act as logical containers within a database, enabling multiple users or applications to access and manage data independently without conflicts. This feature is especially valuable in environments where several users or applications need to interact with the same database server concurrently. Each user or application can have its own schema, preventing accidental interference with each other's data.</p> Note <p>PostgreSQL comes with a default schema, typically called <code>public</code>, but in general, it's a best practice to create custom schemas to better organize and separate database objects, especially in complex or multi-user environments.</p> <p>For more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the detailed guide at this URI, https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-schema/#schema which explains the benefits and use cases for schemas in PostgreSQL.</p> <p>To finalize the initial database setup for Zabbix, we need to configure schema permissions for both the <code>zabbix-srv</code> and <code>zabbix-web</code> users.</p> <p>First, we create a custom schema named <code>zabbix_server</code> and assign ownership to the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Create the db schema</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; CREATE SCHEMA zabbix_server AUTHORIZATION \"zabbix-srv\";\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we set the <code>search path</code> to <code>zabbix_server</code> schema so that it's the default for the current session:</p> <p>Set search path</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SET search_path TO \"zabbix_server\";\n</code></pre> Tip <p>If you prefer not to set the search path manually each time you log in as the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user, you can configure PostgreSQL to automatically use the desired search path. Run the following SQL command to set the default search path for the <code>zabbix-srv</code> role:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; ALTER ROLE \"zabbix-srv\" SET search_path = zabbix_server;\n</code></pre> <p>This command ensures that every time the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user connects to the database, the <code>search_path</code> is automatically set to <code>zabbix_server</code>.</p> <p>To confirm the schema setup, you can list the existing schemas:</p> <p>Verify schema access</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\dn\n          List of schemas\n     Name      |       Owner\n---------------+-------------------\n public        | pg_database_owner\n zabbix_server | zabbix-srv\n(2 rows)\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user has full access to the schema, but the <code>zabbix-web</code> user still needs appropriate permissions to connect and interact with the database. First, we grant <code>USAGE</code> privileges on the schema to allow <code>zabbix-web</code> to connect:</p> <p>Grant access to schema for user zabbix-web</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA zabbix_server TO \"zabbix-web\";\n</code></pre> <p>Now, the <code>zabbix-web</code> user has appropriate access to interact with the schema while maintaining security by limiting permissions to essential operations.</p> <p>If you are ready you can exit the database and return to your linux shell.</p> <p>Exit the database shell</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\q\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, your Zabbix database is ready, but before it can actually be used by Zabbix, we still need to populate the database with the necessary tables and initial data, but that will be covered in the next section when we install the Zabbix server.</p> <p>If you intent to install Zabbix server on a different machine than the one hosting the database you will need to open the host firewall to allow incoming connections to the database server.

By default PHP-FPM is not allowed by SELinux on SUSE to - map exec memory required for PHP JIT compilation, - connect to Zabbix server or - connect to the database server over TCP. We need to tell SELinux to allow all   this:</p> <p>SELinux: Allow PHP-FPM to map exec memory</p> <pre><code>setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1\n</code></pre> Tip <p>To troubleshoot SELinux issues, it is recommended to install the <code>setroubleshoot</code> package which will log any SELinux denials in the system log and provide suggestions on how to resolve them.</p> <p>Depending on your Linux distribution defaults, PHP-FPM may by default not be allowed by SystemD to write to the <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> directory required for the Zabbix frontend setup. To enable this we need to create a drop-in file to allow this:</p> <p>SystemD: Allow PHP-FPM to write to /etc/zabbix/web</p> <pre><code>systemctl edit php-fpm\n</code></pre> <p>This will open an editor to create a drop-in file <code>/etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d/override.conf</code> which will override or extend the existing service file.</p> <p>Add the following lines to the file:</p> <pre><code>[Service]\nReadWritePaths=/etc/zabbix/web\n</code></pre> <p>Then exit the editor and reload the SystemD configuration:</p> <pre><code>systemctl daemon-reload\n</code></pre> How is SystemD preventing PHP-FPM from writing to /etc/zabbix/web? <p>On many modern Linux distributions, SystemD employs a security feature known as sandboxing to restrict the capabilities of services. This is done to enhance security by limiting the access of services to only the resources they need to function. By default, PHP-FPM may be restricted from writing to certain directories, including <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code>, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. This is enforced through SystemD's <code>ProtectSystem</code> and <code>ReadWritePaths</code> directives, which control the file system access of services.</p> Tip <p>Normally write access to <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> is only needed during the initial setup of the Zabbix frontend. After the setup is complete you can remove the drop-in file again to further harden the security of your system.</p> <p>First thing we have to do is alter the Nginx configuration file so that we don't use the standard config and serve the Zabbix frontend on port 80.</p> <p>Edit nginx config for Red Hat</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n</code></pre> <p>In this configuration file look for the following block that starts with <code>server {</code>:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> Tip <p>This block may be different depending on your distribution and Nginx version.</p> <p>Then, comment out the any <code>listen</code> and <code>server_name</code> directives to disable the default http server configuration. You can do this by adding a <code>#</code> at the beginning of each line, like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n    #listen 80;\n    #listen [::]:80;\n    #server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The Zabbix configuration file must now be modified to take over the default service on port 80 we just disabled. Open the following file for editing:</p> <p>Edit Zabbix config for nginx</p> <pre><code>sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/zabbix.conf\n</code></pre> <p>And alter the following lines:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n#       listen          8080;\n#       server_name     example.com;\n\n        root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n        index   index.php;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Remove the <code>#</code> in front of the first 2 lines and modify them with the correct port and domain for your front-end.</p> Tip <p>In case you don't have a domain you can replace <code>servername</code> with <code>_</code>  like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after the edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n        listen          80;\n        server_name     _;\n\n         root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n         index   index.php;\n</code></pre> <p>The web server and PHP-FPM service are now ready for activation and persistent startup.

Zabbix is an open-source project that relies on community contributions for translations, so you can help improve it by contributing your own translations.</p> <p>Visit the translation page at https://translate.zabbix.com/ to assist with the translation efforts. Once your translation is complete and reviewed, it will be included in the next minor patch version of Zabbix. Your contributions help make Zabbix more accessible and improve the overall user experience for everyone.</p> <p>When you're satisfied with the available translations, click <code>Next</code>. You will then be taken to a screen to verify that all prerequisites are satisfied. If any prerequisites are not fulfilled, address those issues first. However, if everything is in order, you should be able to proceed by clicking <code>Next</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>1.7 Zabbix pre-requisites</p> <p>On the next page, you'll configure the database connection parameters:</p> <ol> <li><code>Select the Database Type</code>: Choose either MySQL or PostgreSQL depending on    your setup.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database Host</code>: Provide the IP address or DNS name of your    database server. Use port 3306 for MariaDB/MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database Name</code>: Specify the name of your database. In our case, it    is zabbix. If you are using PostgreSQL, you will also need to provide the    schema name, which is zabbix_server in our case.</li> <li><code>Enther the Database Schema</code>: Only for PostgreSQL users, enter the schema    name created for Zabbix server, which is <code>zabbix_server</code> in our case.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database User</code>: Input the database user created for the web    front-end, remember in our basic installation guide we created 2 users    <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>. One for the frontend and the other one for our    zabbix server so here we will use the user <code>zabbix-web</code>. Enter the    corresponding password for this user.</li> </ol> <p>Ensure that the <code>Database TLS encryption</code> option is not selected, and then click <code>Next step</code> to proceed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.8 Zabbix connections</p> <p>You're almost finished with the setup! The final steps involve:</p> <ol> <li><code>Assigning an Instance Name</code>: Choose a descriptive name for your Zabbix    instance.</li> <li><code>Selecting the Timezone</code>: Choose the timezone that matches your location or    your preferred time zone for the Zabbix interface.</li> <li><code>Setting the Default Time Format</code>: Select the default time format you prefer    to use.</li> <li>Encrypt connections from Web interface: I marked this box but you should    not. This box is to encrypt communications between Zabbix frontend and your    browser. We will cover this later. Once these settings are configured, you    can complete the setup and proceed with any final configuration steps as    needed.</li> </ol> Note <p>It's a good practice to set your Zabbix server to the UTC timezone, especially when managing systems across multiple timezones. Using UTC helps ensure consistency in time-sensitive actions and events, as the server\u2019s timezone is often used for calculating and displaying time-related information.</p> <p></p> <p>1.9 Zabbix summary</p> <p>After clicking <code>Next step</code> again, you'll be taken to a page confirming that the configuration was successful. Click <code>Finish</code> to complete the setup process.</p> <p></p> <p>1.10 Zabbix install</p> <p>We are now ready to login :</p> <p></p> <p>1.11 Zabbix login</p> <ul> <li>Login : Admin</li> <li>Password : zabbix</li> </ul> <p>This concludes our topic on setting up the Zabbix server.

Therefore we need to ensure it's installed.</p> <p>This will also allow the Zabbix user to execute specific configured commands with elevated privileges without needing to switch to the root user entirely.</p> <p>What is sudo</p> <p><code>sudo</code> (short for \"superuser do\") is a command-line utility that allows permitted users to execute commands with the security privileges of another user, typically the superuser (root). It is commonly used in Unix-like operating systems to perform administrative tasks without needing to log in as the root user.</p> <p>To install <code>sudo</code>, run the following command based on your OS:</p> <p>Install sudo</p> <p>Red Hat <pre><code>dnf install sudo\n</code></pre></p> <p>SUSE <pre><code>zypper install sudo\n</code></pre></p> <p>Ubuntu</p> <p>On Ubuntu, <code>sudo</code> is normally installed by default. Root access is managed through <code>sudo</code> for the initial user created during installation.</p> <p>If <code>sudo</code> is already installed, these commands will inform you that the latest version is already present and no further action is needed.

A firewall is a crucial security component that helps protect your server from unauthorized access and potential threats by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</p> <p>To install and enable the firewall, run the following command:</p> <p>Install and enable the firewall</p> <p>Red Hat <pre><code>dnf install firewalld\nsystemctl enable firewalld --now\n</code></pre> SUSE <pre><code>zypper install firewalld\nsystemctl enable firewalld --now\n</code></pre></p> <p>Ubuntu <pre><code>sudo apt install ufw\nsudo ufw enable\n</code></pre></p> What is firewalld / ufw <p>Firewalld is the replacement for iptables in RHEL- and SUSE-based systems and allows changes to take effect immediately without needing to restart the service. If your distribution does not use Firewalld, refer to your OS documentation for the appropriate firewall configuration steps. Ubuntu makes use of UFW which is merely a frontend for iptables.</p> <p>During the Zabbix installation in the next chapters, we will need to open specific ports in the firewall to allow communication between Zabbix components.</p> <p>Alternatively to just opening ports, as we will do in the next chapters, you can also choose to define dedicated firewall zones for specific use cases. This  approach enhances security by isolating services and restricting access based on trust levels. For example...</p> <p>Create a firewalld zone for database access</p> <pre><code>firewall-cmd --new-zone=db_zone --permanent\n</code></pre> <p>You can confirm the creation of the zone by executing the following command:</p> <p>Verify the zone creation</p> <pre><code>localhost:~ # firewall-cmd --get-zones\nblock dmz drop external home internal nm-shared db_zone public trusted work\n</code></pre> <p>Using zones in firewalld to configure firewall rules provides several advantages in terms of security, flexibility, and ease of management. Here\u2019s why zones are beneficial:</p> <ul> <li>Granular Access Control :</li> </ul> Firewalld zones allow different levels of trust for different network interfaces and IP ranges. You can define which systems are allowed to connect to PostgreSQL based on their trust level. <ul> <li>Simplified Rule management:</li> </ul> Instead of manually defining complex iptables rules, zones provide an organized way to group and manage firewall rules based on usage scenarios. <ul> <li>Enhanced security:</li> </ul> By restricting application access to a specific zone, you prevent unauthorized connections from other interfaces or networks. <ul> <li>Dynamic configuration:</li> </ul> Firewalld supports runtime and permanent rule configurations, allowing changes without disrupting existing connections. <ul> <li>Multi-Interface support:</li> </ul> If the server has multiple network interfaces, zones allow different security policies for each interface. <p>Bringing everything together to add a zone for, in this example, PostgreSQL it would look like this:</p> <p>Firewalld with zone config for PostgreSQL database access</p> <pre><code>firewall-cmd --new-zone=db_zone --permanent\nfirewall-cmd --zone=db_zone --add-service=postgresql --permanent\nfirewall-cmd --zone=db_zone --add-source=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/32 --permanent\nfirewall-cmd --reload\n</code></pre> <p>Where the <code>source IP</code> is the only address permitted to establish a connection to the database.</p> <p>If you wish to use zones when using firewalld, ensure to adapt the instructions in the following chapters accordingly.</p>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"ch00-getting-started/Requirements/#time-server","title":"Time Server","text":"<p>Another crucial step is configuring the time server and syncing the Zabbix server using an NTP client.

There are many different ways to setup a Zabbix server. We will cover the most common setups with MariaDB and PostgreSQL on RHEL- and SLES-based distro's and Ubuntu.</p> <p>Before beginning the installation, it is important to understand the architecture of Zabbix. The Zabbix server is structured in a modular fashion, composed of three main components, which we will discuss in detail.</p> <ul> <li>The Zabbix server</li> <li>The Zabbix web server</li> <li>The Zabbix database</li> </ul> <p>Creation of DB users</p> <p>In our setup we will create 2 DB users <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>. The  zabbix-web user will be used for the frontend to connect to our zabbix database. The zabbix-srv user will be used by our zabbix server to connect to the database. This allows us to limit the permissions for every user to only what is strictly needed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.1 Zabbix basic split installation</p> <p>All of these components can either be installed on a single server or distributed across three separate servers. The core of the system is the Zabbix server, often referred to as the \"brain.\" This component is responsible for processing trigger calculations and sending alerts. The database serves as the storage for the Zabbix server's configuration and all the data it collects. The web server provides the user interface (front-end) for interacting with the system. It is important to note that the Zabbix API is part of the front-end component, not the Zabbix server itself.</p> <p>These components must function together seamlessly, as illustrated in the diagram above. The Zabbix server must read configurations and store monitoring data in the database, while the front-end needs access to read and write configuration data. Furthermore, the front-end must be able to check the status of the Zabbix server and retrieve additional necessary information to ensure smooth operation.</p> <p>For our setup, we will be using two virtual machines (VMs): one VM will host both the Zabbix server and the Zabbix web front-end, while the second VM will host the Zabbix database.</p> Note <p>It is perfectly possible to install all components on one single VM or every component on a separate VM. The reason why we split the DB in our example is because the database will probably be the first component giving you performance headaches. It is also the component that needs some extra attention when we split it from the other components, so for this reason we have chosen in this example to split the database  from the rest of the setup.</p> <p>We will cover the following topics:</p> <ul> <li>Install our Database based on MariaDB.</li> <li>Install our Database based on PostgreSQL.</li> <li>Installing the Zabbix server.</li> <li>Install the frontend.</li> </ul>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"ch01-zabbix-components/chapter/","title":"Zabbix components, basic functions and installation","text":"<p>In this chapter, we expand on the foundational knowledge from the \"Getting Started\" section to provide a comprehensive guide for both beginners who are installing Zabbix for the first time and advanced users who seek to optimize their setup.

Zabbix supports several database options: MySQL/Percona, MariaDB,  PostgreSQL (including TimescaleDB), and Oracle (up to Zabbix 7.0).</p> Oracle Database deprecation <p>Zabbix 7.0 marks the final release to offer support for Oracle Database. Consequently, systems running Zabbix 7.0 or any prior version must undertake a database migration to either PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a compatible fork such as MariaDB before upgrading to a later Zabbix release. This migration is a mandatory step to ensure continued functionality and compatibility with future Zabbix versions.</p> <p>All supported databases perform similarly under typical Zabbix workloads, and  Zabbix treats them equally in terms of functionality. As such, the choice  primarily depends on your or your team\u2019s familiarity with a particular database system.

This makes it especially well-suited for monitoring applications  like Zabbix, which handle large volumes of timestamped data.</p> <p>In large-scale environments with high-frequency data collection, TimescaleDB can deliver significant performance benefits, including improved query speeds and built-in compression to reduce storage requirements.

Execute the following command to create the database <code>zabbix</code> with the owner set to  <code>zabbix-srv</code> and the character encoding set to <code>Unicode</code> as required by Zabbix:</p> <p>Create DB</p> <pre><code>sudo -u postgres createdb -E Unicode -T template0 -O zabbix-srv zabbix\n</code></pre> What is this 'template0'? <p>In PostgreSQL, <code>template0</code> is a default database template that serves as a pristine copy of the database system. When creating a new database using <code>template0</code>, it ensures that the new database starts with a clean slate, without any pre-existing objects or configurations that might be present in other templates. This is particularly useful when you want to create a database with specific settings or extensions without inheriting any unwanted elements from other templates.</p> <p>Once the database is created, you should verify the connection and ensure that the correct user session is active. To do this, log into the zabbix database using the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Login as user zabbix-srv</p> <pre><code>psql -d zabbix -U zabbix-srv\n</code></pre> <p>After logging in, run the following SQL query to confirm that both the <code>session_user</code> and <code>current_user</code> are set to <code>zabbix-srv</code>:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SELECT session_user, current_user;\n session_user | current_user\n--------------+--------------\n zabbix-srv   | zabbix-srv\n(1 row)\n</code></pre> <p>If the output matches, you are successfully connected to the database with the correct user.</p> <p>PostgreSQL differs significantly from MySQL or MariaDB in several aspects, and one of the key features that sets it apart is its use of schemas. Unlike MySQL, where databases are more standalone, PostgreSQL's schema system provides a structured, multi-user environment within a single database.</p> <p>Schemas act as logical containers within a database, enabling multiple users or applications to access and manage data independently without conflicts. This feature is especially valuable in environments where several users or applications need to interact with the same database server concurrently. Each user or application can have its own schema, preventing accidental interference with each other's data.</p> Note <p>PostgreSQL comes with a default schema, typically called <code>public</code>, but in general, it's a best practice to create custom schemas to better organize and separate database objects, especially in complex or multi-user environments.</p> <p>For more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the detailed guide at this URI, https://hevodata.com/learn/postgresql-schema/#schema which explains the benefits and use cases for schemas in PostgreSQL.</p> <p>To finalize the initial database setup for Zabbix, we need to configure schema permissions for both the <code>zabbix-srv</code> and <code>zabbix-web</code> users.</p> <p>First, we create a custom schema named <code>zabbix_server</code> and assign ownership to the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user:</p> <p>Create the db schema</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; CREATE SCHEMA zabbix_server AUTHORIZATION \"zabbix-srv\";\n</code></pre> <p>Next, we set the <code>search path</code> to <code>zabbix_server</code> schema so that it's the default for the current session:</p> <p>Set search path</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; SET search_path TO \"zabbix_server\";\n</code></pre> Tip <p>If you prefer not to set the search path manually each time you log in as the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user, you can configure PostgreSQL to automatically use the desired search path. Run the following SQL command to set the default search path for the <code>zabbix-srv</code> role:</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; ALTER ROLE \"zabbix-srv\" SET search_path = zabbix_server;\n</code></pre> <p>This command ensures that every time the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user connects to the database, the <code>search_path</code> is automatically set to <code>zabbix_server</code>.</p> <p>To confirm the schema setup, you can list the existing schemas:</p> <p>Verify schema access</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\dn\n          List of schemas\n     Name      |       Owner\n---------------+-------------------\n public        | pg_database_owner\n zabbix_server | zabbix-srv\n(2 rows)\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, the <code>zabbix-srv</code> user has full access to the schema, but the <code>zabbix-web</code> user still needs appropriate permissions to connect and interact with the database. First, we grant <code>USAGE</code> privileges on the schema to allow <code>zabbix-web</code> to connect:</p> <p>Grant access to schema for user zabbix-web</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA zabbix_server TO \"zabbix-web\";\n</code></pre> <p>Now, the <code>zabbix-web</code> user has appropriate access to interact with the schema while maintaining security by limiting permissions to essential operations.</p> <p>If you are ready you can exit the database and return to your linux shell.</p> <p>Exit the database shell</p> <pre><code>zabbix=&gt; \\q\n</code></pre> <p>At this point, your Zabbix database is ready, but before it can actually be used by Zabbix, we still need to populate the database with the necessary tables and initial data, but that will be covered in the next section when we install the Zabbix server.</p> <p>If you intent to install Zabbix server on a different machine than the one hosting the database you will need to open the host firewall to allow incoming connections to the database server.

By default PHP-FPM is not allowed by SELinux on SUSE to  - map exec memory required for PHP JIT compilation, - connect to Zabbix server or - connect to the database server over TCP. We need to tell SELinux to allow all this:</p> <p>SELinux: Allow PHP-FPM to map exec memory</p> <pre><code>setsebool -P httpd_execmem 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix 1\nsetsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db 1\n</code></pre> Tip <p>To troubleshoot SELinux issues, it is recommended to install the <code>setroubleshoot</code> package which will log any SELinux denials in the system log and provide suggestions on how to resolve them.</p> <p>Depending on your Linux distribution defaults, PHP-FPM may by default not be  allowed by SystemD to write to the <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> directory required for the Zabbix frontend setup. To enable this we need to create a drop-in file to allow this:</p> <p>SystemD: Allow PHP-FPM to write to /etc/zabbix/web</p> <pre><code>systemctl edit php-fpm\n</code></pre> <p>This will open an editor to create a drop-in file <code>/etc/systemd/system/php-fpm.service.d/override.conf</code> which will override or extend the existing service file.</p> <p>Add the following lines to the file:</p> <pre><code>[Service]\nReadWritePaths=/etc/zabbix/web\n</code></pre> <p>Then exit the editor and reload the SystemD configuration:</p> <pre><code>systemctl daemon-reload\n</code></pre> How is SystemD preventing PHP-FPM from writing to /etc/zabbix/web? <p>On many modern Linux distributions, SystemD employs a security feature known as sandboxing to restrict the capabilities of services. This is done to enhance security by limiting the access of services to only the resources they need to function. By default, PHP-FPM may be restricted from writing to certain directories, including <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code>, to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. This is enforced through SystemD's <code>ProtectSystem</code> and <code>ReadWritePaths</code> directives, which control the file system access of services.</p> Tip <p>Normally write access to <code>/etc/zabbix/web</code> is only needed during the initial setup of the Zabbix frontend. After the setup is complete you can remove the drop-in file again to further harden the security of your system.</p> <p>First thing we have to do is alter the Nginx configuration file so that we don't use the standard config and serve the Zabbix frontend on port 80.</p> <p>Edit nginx config for Red Hat</p> <pre><code>vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n</code></pre> <p>In this configuration file look for the following block that starts with <code>server {</code>:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n    server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> Tip <p>This block may be different depending on your distribution and Nginx version.</p> <p>Then, comment out the any <code>listen</code> and <code>server_name</code> directives to disable the default http server configuration. You can do this by adding a <code>#</code> at the beginning of each line, like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n    #listen 80;\n    #listen [::]:80;\n    #server_name *;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The Zabbix configuration file must now be modified to take over the default  service on port 80 we just disabled. Open the following file for editing:</p> <p>Edit Zabbix config for nginx</p> <pre><code>sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/zabbix.conf\n</code></pre> <p>And alter the following lines:</p> <p>Original config</p> <pre><code>server {\n#       listen          8080;\n#       server_name     example.com;\n\n        root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n        index   index.php;\n...\n</code></pre> <p>Remove the <code>#</code> in front of the first 2 lines and modify them with the correct  port and domain for your front-end. </p> Tip <p>In case you don't have a domain you can replace <code>servername</code> with <code>_</code>  like in the example below:</p> <p>Config after the edit</p> <pre><code>server {\n        listen          80;\n        server_name     _;\n\n         root    /usr/share/zabbix;\n\n         index   index.php;\n</code></pre> <p>The web server and PHP-FPM service are now ready for activation and persistent startup.

Use port 3306 for MariaDB/MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database Name</code>: Specify the name of your database. In our case, it    is zabbix. If you are using PostgreSQL, you will also need to provide the schema    name, which is zabbix_server in our case.</li> <li><code>Enther the Database Schema</code>: Only for PostgreSQL users, enter the schema name    created for Zabbix server, which is <code>zabbix_server</code> in our case.</li> <li><code>Enter the Database User</code>: Input the database user created for the web front-end,    remember in our basic installation guide we created 2 users <code>zabbix-web</code> and <code>zabbix-srv</code>.    One for the frontend and the other one for our zabbix server so here we will use     the user <code>zabbix-web</code>. Enter the corresponding password for this user.</li> </ol> <p>Ensure that the <code>Database TLS encryption</code> option is not selected, and then click <code>Next step</code> to proceed.</p> <p></p> <p>1.8 Zabbix connections</p> <p>You're almost finished with the setup!

This box is to encrypt communications between Zabbix frontend and your    browser. We will cover this later.    Once these settings are configured, you can complete the setup and proceed with any final configuration steps as needed.</li> </ol> Note <p>It's a good practice to set your Zabbix server to the UTC timezone, especially when managing systems across multiple timezones.

Additionally, double-check for duplicate configuration lines; if there are multiple lines with the same parameter, Zabbix will use the value from the last occurrence.</p> <p>For our setup, the configuration will look like this:</p> <p>Example database.conf</p> <p>MariaDB/MySQL: <pre><code># MariaDB database configuration\nDBHost=&lt;ip or dns of your MariaDB server&gt;\nDBName=zabbix\nDBUser=zabbix-srv\nDBPassword=&lt;your super secret password&gt;\nDBPort=3306\n</code></pre></p> <p>PostgreSQL: <pre><code># PostgreSQL database configuration\nDBHost=&lt;ip or dns of your PostgreSQL server&gt;\nDBName=zabbix\nDBSchema=zabbix_server\nDBUser=zabbix-srv\nDBPassword=&lt;your super secret password&gt;\nDBPort=5432\n</code></pre></p> <p>In this example:</p> <ul> <li>DBHost refers to the host where your database is running (use localhost if it's   on the same machine).</li> <li>DBName is the name of the Zabbix database.</li> <li>DBSchema is the schema name used in PostgreSQL (only needed for PostgreSQL).</li> <li>DBUser is the database user.</li> <li>DBPassword is the password for the database user.</li> <li>DBPort is the port number on which your database server is listening (default for   MySQL/MariaDB is 3306 and PostgreSQL is 5432).</li> </ul> <p>Make sure the settings reflect your environment's database configuration.</p>","tags":["beginner"]},{"location":"ch01-zabbix-components/zabbix-server/#configure-firewall-to-allow-zabbix-trapper-connections","title":"Configure firewall to allow Zabbix trapper connections","text":"<p>Back on your Zabbix server machine, we need to ensure that the firewall is configured to allow incoming connections to the Zabbix server.</p> <p>Your Zabbix server needs to accept incoming connections from Zabbix agents, senders, and proxies.

If no trapper is listening the rest of the information can not be displayed IP and port of the Zabbix server Zabbix server version This shows us the version of the <code>Zabbix server</code> so the version you see at the bottom of your screen is the one from the Zabbix frontend and can be different but should be in the same major version. Version Number Zabbix frontend version This is the version of the frontend and should match with what you see at the bottom of your screen. Version Number Number of hosts (enabled/disabled) The total number of hosts configured on our system How many of those are enabled and disabled Number of templates The number of templates installed on our Zabbix server. Number of items (enabled/disabled/not supported) This line shows us the number of items we have configured in total in this case 99 90 are enabled and 0 are disabled but 9 of them are unsupported. This last number is important as those are items not working. We will look into this later why it happens and how to fix it. For now remember that a high number of unsupported items is not a good idea. Number of triggers (Enabled/disabled[problem/ok]) The number of triggers configured Number of enabled and disabled triggers. Just as with items we also see if there are triggers that are in a problem state or ok state. A trigger in a problem state is a non working trigger something we need to monitor and fix. We will cover this also later. Number of users (online) Here we see the number of users that are configured on our system The number of users currently online. Required server performance, nvps The number of new values per second that Zabbix will process per second.

Instead you can create and include separate configuration files for any additional or modified parameters.</p> <p>On SUSE 16 and later, this feature is already enabled and configured by default in <code>/usr/etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.conf</code>.</p> <p>On other distributions, you may need to enable it manually in  <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.conf</code>.</p> <p>To enable this feature, ensure the next line exists and is not commented (with a <code>#</code> in front of it):</p> <pre><code>Include=/etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.d/*.conf\n</code></pre> <p>The path <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.d/</code> should already be created by the installed package, but ensure it really exists.</p> <p>Now we wil create a custom configuration file <code>general.conf</code> in this <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.d/</code> directory that will hold some general proxy settings:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The first option we will have to set is <code>ProxyMode</code>:</p> <ul> <li>Set this to <code>0</code> for an Active proxy.</li> <li>Set this to <code>1</code> for a Passive proxy.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The other option that is important is the option <code>Server</code> which defaults to <code>127.0.0.1</code>,   so we need to replace this with the IP or DNS name of our Zabbix Server.</p> </li> </ul> Note <p>You can fill in multiple servers here in case you have more than one Zabbix Server connecting to your proxy.

Remember in our frontend we gave our Active proxy the name <code>ProxyA</code>, so now    we have to fill in the exact same name here for hostname.   Just like a Zabbix agent in active mode Zabbix server will use the name as a   unique identifier.\\   For a passive proxy this option matters less, but for clarity it is best to    keep it the same: <code>ProxyP</code> in our case. </p> </li> <li> <p>On an Active proxy you may also consider setting <code>ProxyConfigFrequency</code> and    <code>DataSenderFrequency</code> to fine-tune communication with the Zabbix server, but   generally speaking, the defaults should suffice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Other options to consider are <code>ProxyOfflineBuffer</code> and <code>ProxyLocalBuffer</code> to   make sure the proxy can keep up with Zabbix server outages and the amount of   monitored data it ingests.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The <code>general.conf</code> file should now look at least something like this:</p> /etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.d/general.conf <pre><code>ProxyMode=0\nServer=192.168.0.50\nHostname=ProxyA\n</code></pre> <p>To configure the database settings, create a dedicated configuration file at  <code>/etc/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.d/database.conf</code>.

In case of a proxy or system crash, all data is retained and will be sent to the Zabbix server as soon as the proxy is started again.</p> <p>This is slower due to database I/O but is highly reliable.</p> <code>memory</code> - Memory buffer <p>Data is stored in RAM and is not written to disk. This makes sure the data is sent to the Zabbix server as quickly as possible as there is no I/O wait time for the database involved. Downside is that when the proxy or the system  crashes when the proxy still has data in the buffer, not yet received by the server, that data will be lost. Also when the RAM buffer overflows (<code>ProxyMemoryBufferSize</code>), possibly due to a sudden burst of incoming items or the Zabbix server being unavailable for some time, older data will be  removed from the buffer before it is sent to the Zabbix server.</p> <code>hybrid</code> - Hybrid buffer (default for new installations since Zabbix 7.0) <p>Data is primarily stored in RAM but is automatically written to the database when the memory buffer is full, the data is too old or when the proxy is  stopped. This makes sure that data is preserved in case the Zabbix server is unreachable for a longer period or when there are bursts of many incoming items and hereby balances speed and reliability.</p> Warning <p>In Proxies that where installed before <code>7.0</code> the data was first written to disk in the database and then sent to the <code>Zabbix server</code>. For these installations when we upgrade this remains the default behavior after upgrading to Zabbix 7.x or higher. It's now recommended for performance reasons to use the new setting <code>hybrid</code> and to define the <code>ProxyMemoryBufferSize</code>.</p> <p>Once you have made all the changes you need in the config file besides the ones we have covered, we only need to enable the service and start our proxy. Of course don't forget to open the firewall port <code>10051</code> on your Zabbix server side for the active proxy.</p> <p>Enable and start the proxy service</p> <pre><code>sudo systemctl enable zabbix-proxy --now\n</code></pre> <p>If all goes well we can check the log file from our proxy and we will see that Zabbix has created the database by itself.</p> View Zabbix proxy logs <pre><code>localhost:~&gt; sudo tail -f /var/log/zabbix/zabbix_proxy.log`\n11134:20250519:152232.419 Starting Zabbix Proxy (active) [Zabbix proxy].

We've explored the fundamental distinction between active and passive proxy modes, highlighting how each serves different deployment scenarios and network topologies. Understanding their individual strengths, from simplified firewall configurations with active proxies to the server-initiated control of passive proxies, is crucial for optimal system design.</p> <p>We delved into the comprehensive settings that govern proxy behavior, emphasizing how proper configuration of parameters like proxy polling intervals and data buffers, directly impacts performance and data accuracy. The evolution of data storage mechanisms within the proxy, from purely memory-based approaches to the flexible options of disk and hybrid storage, empowers administrators to finely tune resource utilization and data persistence based on their specific needs and the volume of monitored data.</p> <p>Finally, we examined the critical advancements in configuration synchronization, particularly the significant improvements introduced with Zabbix 7.0. The shift towards more efficient and streamlined config sync processes, moving beyond the limitations of earlier versions, underscores Zabbix's continuous commitment to enhancing operational efficiency and simplifying large-scale deployments.</p> <p>In essence, Zabbix proxies are far more than simple data forwarders; they are intelligent intermediaries that offload significant processing from the central Zabbix server, reduce network traffic, and enhance the resilience of your monitoring solution. By carefully selecting the appropriate proxy type, meticulously configuring its settings, and leveraging the latest features in data storage and configuration management, you can unlock the full potential of Zabbix to monitor even the most complex and geographically dispersed environments with unparalleled efficiency and reliability.

But here is a short overview of options available to use.</p> <code>zabbix_proxy --runtime-control housekeeper_execute</code> <p>Triggers the immediate execution of the Zabbix housekeeper process on the  proxy. The housekeeper is responsible for cleaning up outdated data (e.g.,  old history, trends, or events) according to the configured retention periods  in Zabbix. This command forces the housekeeper to run now, instead of waiting  for its scheduled interval.</p> <code>zabbix_proxy --runtime-control log_level_increase=target</code> <p>Increases the log verbosity level for a specific target process (e.g., by type  like <code>configuration syncer</code>, <code>housekeeper</code>, <code>icmp pinger</code>, by type and number like <code>poller,3</code> or by PID). This is useful for debugging or troubleshooting,  as it provides more detailed log output for the specified target. For a full  list of available targets, check the man-page of <code>zabbix_proxy</code>. Example: <code>log_level_increase=\"http poller\"</code> would make http poller-related logs more verbose.</p> <code>zabbix_proxy --runtime-control log_level_decrease=target</code> <p>Decreases the log verbosity level for a specific target, reducing the amount  of log output generated. This is helpful to lower noise in logs after debugging or to optimize performance by reducing I/O overhead. Example: <code>log_level_decrease=trapper,2</code> would reduce the verbosity of  trapper-related logs of the second trapper process.</p> <code>zabbix_proxy --runtime-control snmp_cache_reload</code> <p>Forces the proxy to reload its SNMP cache. This is useful if you\u2019ve made  changes to SNMP configurations (e.g., updated community strings, OIDs, or  device IPs) and want the proxy to immediately pick up the new settings  without restarting the entire service.</p> <code>zabbix_proxy --runtime-control diaginfo=section</code> <p>Generates diagnostic information for a specific section of the proxy\u2019s  operation. This is typically used for troubleshooting or performance analysis.  The section parameter can target areas like historycache, preprocessing or locks.

You can of course slice them with the help of scripts and so extract needed valuable pieces to be stored individually, as separate items. However, there is a native way in Zabbix which can do the very same thing without a need to involve any scripting. And that is something called \"Dependent items\".</p> <p>Think of \"Dependent items\" as small fragments of your large dataset. Of course, nothing limits or tells you that your dataset must be large. It can also be small, but the smaller - the less sense the dependent items would make. When having something large to be collected, you have to collect that data only once and have the splitting being done by preprocessing.</p> <p>Another use case when you might benefit from dependent items is when data collection has \"high cost\", in terms of time retrieving it or when network traffic matters. For example, some remote resource which you want to collect has slow network or you want to save each and every byte sent over the network, but there are multiple things in that resource which you want to monitor. Without dependent items approach you would need to retrieve that resource as many times as you have unique items, or store it once and then slice it on your own. But with dependent items, you need to collect such data only once and transform it into individual metrics just by employing native Zabbix features.</p> <p>So basically, the beauty of dependent items lies in the data collection efficiency.</p> <p>There are three main concepts involved when talking about \"Dependent items\":</p> <ul> <li>master item</li> <li>dependent item</li> <li>preprocessing</li> </ul> <p>Master item is just a regular Zabbix item.

These options enable and configure the Java Management Extensions (JMX) agent, which allows for remote monitoring and management of the application, in this case, Apache Tomcat.</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>JAVA_OPTS=\"... \"</code>   This is a variable used by Tomcat's startup scripts to hold a collection of   command-line arguments for the Java process. The backslash (<code>\\</code>) at the end of   each line is a shell syntax feature that allows a single command or variable   to span multiple lines, making the configuration easier to read.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true</code>   This is the main switch to enable the JMX remote agent. By setting this to <code>true</code>,   you're telling the JVM to start the JMX management server.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8686</code>   This option specifies the port number for the JMX agent to listen on for   incoming connections. In this case, it's set to <code>8686</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=8686</code>   This sets the port for the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) server. The JMX   agent uses RMI to communicate with remote clients. In this configuration,   both the JMX agent and the RMI server are configured to use the same port,   simplifying the setup.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false</code>   This disables authentication for JMX connections. For production environments,   this should be set to <code>true</code> to require a username and password. Setting it to   <code>false</code> is only suitable for development or testing environments.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false</code>   This disables Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for JMX connections, meaning communication   is not encrypted. Like authentication, this should be set to <code>true</code> in a production   environment to secure the connection.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=&lt;local ip&gt;\"</code>   This is a crucial option that tells the RMI server which IP address to announce   to clients. Clients will use this hostname to connect to the server. If this   is not explicitly set, the RMI server might use the server's internal hostname   or a loopback address (<code>127.0.0.1</code>), which would prevent external connections.   By setting it to <code>&lt;your local IP&gt;</code>, you ensure that the JMX port is bound to   the correct network interface for remote access.</p> </li> </ul> Note <pre><code>There isn't a single, universally \"standard\" port for JMX that is accepted\nacross all applications and vendors. The JMX specification itself does not\ndefine a default port, leaving it to the implementer to choose one.\n\nHowever, certain ports have become common or de facto standards within the Java\necosystem. The most frequently seen ports for JMX are in the high-number range,\ntypically:\n\n- 1099: This port is a historic default for the RMI Registry, which JMX often\n  uses for communication. While it's not strictly a JMX port, it's often\n  associated with older JMX configurations.\n\n- 8686: This port is a well-accepted and formally registered port for JMX with\n  the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

This makes it a great choice because it's officially\n  recognized and less likely to conflict with other common services.\n\nWhy Port 8686 is a Good Choice?\nPort 8686 is a User Port (1024-49151), which means it's available for registered\nservices but isn't a \"well known\" port that requires a special permission level\nto use.

Some of the most used ones are important to properly understand their functioning. </p> <p>Regular expression Regular expressions are a whole subject on its own, there are many books on the topic on its own. We won't going over the details here, for that we recommend going to https://regex101.com. On this website you can read extensive documentation about regular expressions, as well as test your existing ones. </p> <p>Let's start with a basic example, where we have an item that received the value: The error is value: 0. Let's say we want to get numeric value from the string, we could configure our preprocessing like this.</p> <p> 4.37 Preprocessing regular expression</p> <p>This would then result in the value 0, which we can store as the <code>Numeric (unsigned)</code> item type of information. The basic functionality of the regular expression preprocessing step as you can see is to extract values from larger data.</p> <p>JSONPath and additional steps Within Zabbix monitoring, JSON data structures are used quite a lot. We can find it in Low Level Discovery, export files and it is often the data format sent back by API's. As such, being able to process JSON datasets is important and that is where JSONPath comes in. Let's say we have a basic JSON dataset we collected from an API.</p> <p>Example JSON</p> <pre><code>{\n\"hostname\": \"webserver01\",\n\"c\": true,\n\"retry_count\": 3\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Now with JSONpath, we could extract these values. Let's say we want to get the <code>enabled</code> value and store it as a <code>Numeric (unsigned)</code> value. We could do the following.</p> <p> 4.38 Preprocessing JSONPath</p> <p>This will extract the value <code>true</code>. However, as a bonus we said we would also to store this extracted value as a <code>Numeric (unsigned)</code> value. To do this, I used an additional 2 preprocessing steps <code>replace</code>. Replacing <code>false</code> with <code>0</code> and <code>true</code> with <code>1</code>. If we press the <code>Test all steps</code> button, we can see the result happen live.</p> <p> 4.39 Preprocessing JSONPath test</p> <p>It's important to know that we can add an unlimited amount of preprocessing steps, but that Zabbix will always execute all of them in the order in which they are defined. First, we extract the value from JSON. Second, we try to replace <code>false</code> with <code>0</code> which didn't do anything as there was no match. Third, we replace <code>true</code> with <code>1</code> which worked. Now all we have to do is apply a value mapping to translate true and false back into human readable format. The big benefit here being that storing these kinds of values as <code>Numeric (unsigned)</code> gives us a lot more trigger functions as options for alerting. It also means we can now store the value in <code>Trend</code> tables, as only <code>Numeric</code> data types are stores as trends.</p> <p>SNMP walk value </p> <p>SNMP walk to JSON</p> <p>Custom multiplier  The customer multiplier is simple, but important. In Zabbix you might often find that you receive a value, that you would want to store slightly differently. Specifically, this preprocessing step is often used to convert numbers to their base value. Your device might be giving you MegaBytes (MB) for example, where Zabbix would like us to store Bytes (B) instead. </p> <p> 4.40 Preprocessing Custom Multiplier</p> <p>This will now store the received MegaByte value as Bytes. Now, we can set the item <code>Units</code> setting to B and it will convert the Bytes stored to a human readable Mega, Giga, Tera, etc.</p> <p>Storing base values is always preferred in Zabbix, so we can do the conversion with <code>Units</code> on the item later. This results in a more dynamic setup.</p> <p>Simple Change and Change per second We quickly mentioned the <code>Simple Change</code> before, which calculates the difference between <code>Last</code> and <code>Previous</code> value. Change per second goes a step further however by introducing a time based calculation to the formula. </p> <p>A simple change calculation would look like this.</p> Position Value Last #1 9 Last #2 (previous) 4 ----- 5 <p>We can see the result here is a simple 5, using the formula <code>Last - Previous</code>. In Zabbix the last received value is often indicated by <code>Last #1</code> and the value before it as <code>Last #2</code>. Next, let's introduce the time based calculation with <code>Change per second</code>, so we see something more difficult.</p> Position Value Timestamp (Unixtime) Change per second Last #1 13 1763282130 7 Last #2 (previous) 6 1763282100 30 ---- - ------------------- - -------------------- / 7 30 0.23333333 <p>We can see the calculation is the same in principle, we subtract <code>Last #1</code> and <code>Last #2</code>. We also takes the Unixtime stamp of when <code>Last #1</code> and <code>Last #2</code> were collected, subtracting those. Subtracting those time values gives us the time passed between <code>Last #1</code> and <code>Last #2</code>. Then the last step is to divide the values, giving us an estimate of how much values were received per second. Of course, the shorter our update interval is, the closer the estimate. But it gives us an accurate average over time.</p> <p>This kind of calculation works with what we call <code>Counters</code>, values that always increase on our monitoring targets. For example, network interfaces Bits received/sent are often times counters. These work by calculating how much data has passed over the interface in total, often since the last reboot. Often times, a useless metric to us unless we convert it with <code>Change per second</code> when it gives us a nice <code>Bits/s</code>. This allows us to monitor network traffic over time, instead of just a total. </p> <p>Javascript With  many APIs out there being used to make monitoring data available to us, responses are getting more complex. It might happen that you get a response that isn't perfect for us to store in Zabbix. One of my favourite examples is dates and times. Sometimes developers might decide to gives us back a string value with the dates, for example:</p> <ul> <li>Aug 21 1991</li> <li>Aug 24 1991</li> <li>May 8 1945</li> </ul> <p>Using Javascript, we could convert these dates into a nice <code>Unixtime</code> stamp. Unixtime is something Zabbix understands as a Unit and can be used in trigger functions. </p> <p>Example Javascript</p> <pre><code>// Expecting: \"Feb 20 2040\"\n    var months = {\n        Jan: 0, Feb: 1, Mar: 2, Apr: 3, May: 4, Jun: 5,\n        Jul: 6, Aug: 7, Sep: 8, Oct: 9, Nov: 10, Dec: 11\n    };\n\n    if (typeof value !== 'string') {\n        return value;\n    }\n\n    // Split on whitespace\n    var parts = value.trim().split(/\\s+/);\n    if (parts.length !== 3) {\n        return value; // or throw, depending on how strict you want to be\n    }\n\n    var monStr = parts[0];\n    var day = parseInt(parts[1], 10);\n    var year = parseInt(parts[2], 10);\n\n    var month = months[monStr];\n    if (month === undefined || isNaN(day) || isNaN(year)) {\n        return value;\n    }\n\n    // Use UTC midnight of that date, convert ms \u2192 seconds\n    var ts = Date.UTC(year, month, day) / 1000;\n\n    return ts;\n</code></pre> <p>Keep in mind, Zabbix will already put this Javascript code in a function for preprocessing as <code>function (value) { }</code>. When testing this code, we can see it executed for us now, converting out weird date format into a nice Unixtime.</p> <p> 4.41 Preprocessing Javascript</p> <p>Discard unchanged with heartbeat  Shortly, I'd also like to discuss the <code>Discard unchanged with heartbeat</code> preprocessing in more detail. Let's say we set up our preprocessing step <code>Discard unchanged with heartbeat</code> with a heartbeat value of <code>5m</code>. We might see the following happen.</p> <p>| Value | Timestamp | Stored value? | | :---- | :-------- | |   0   |    Now    | No |   0   |   1m ago  | Yes |   1   |   2m ago  | Yes |   1   |   3m ago  | No |   1   |   4m ago  | No |   1   |   5m ago  | No |   1   |   6m ago  | No |   1   |   7m ago  | No |   1   |   8m ago  | Yes |   0   |   9m ago  | Yes</p> <p>We can see that we only store the value if it changes from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code> or from <code>1</code> to <code>0</code> in this case. However, at the <code>2m ago</code> timestamp we can see an exception. This specific value had passed the 5 minute heartbeat interval, meaning we store this value even though it had not changed yet. This can be used to make sure we still save a value from time to time, which can be useful for data integrity or crafting your trigger expressions later on.</p>","tags":["advanced"]},{"location":"ch04-zabbix-collecting-data/preprocessing/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>As we can see preprocessing can be used to turns raw received data into structured, meaningful monitoring data.

This chapter introduces an alternative approach monitoring via SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) which does not require the installation of a Zabbix agent on the monitored device. This method is especially useful in environments where agent based monitoring is impractical, restricted or simply not allowed.</p> <p>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely adopted protocol designed for monitoring and managing devices on IP networks. Despite the word \"management\" in its name, SNMP is predominantly employed for monitoring purposes. Its widespread support across networking hardware and embedded systems has made it a cornerstone of modern network visibility solutions.</p> <p>Originally developed in the late 1980s, SNMP has undergone several revisions. Early versions, such as SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, were hampered by significant security limitations. As a result, while SNMP includes functionality for remote device configuration, its use has remained largely to status monitoring rather than active management of devices.</p> <p>SNMP is especially valuable for monitoring resource constrained or embedded devices that lack the capacity to run a full monitoring agent.</p> <p>Common examples include:</p> <ul> <li>Printers</li> <li>Network switches, routers, and firewalls</li> <li>Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPSs)</li> <li>NAS (Network-Attached Storage) appliances</li> <li>Environmental sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity sensors)</li> </ul> <p>These devices often provide built-in SNMP support, making them accessible for monitoring with minimal configuration. Additionally, SNMP can be employed on standard servers where installing or maintaining a Zabbix agent is either impractical or not permitted. This could be due to administrative policies, software compatibility or security concerns, or simply a desire to reduce system footprint.</p> <p>Recognizing the ubiquity of SNMP, Zabbix provides native SNMP support. This capability is powered by the open-source Net-SNMP suite, available at http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net. The integration allows Zabbix to retrieve metrics from SNMP-enabled devices using industry standard mechanisms.</p> <p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p> <ul> <li>An introduction to the Net-SNMP toolkit and its core utilities.</li> <li>How to integrate MIB (Management Information Base) files into Zabbix, enabling   the platform to interpret SNMP data correctly.</li> <li>The process of SNMP polling within Zabbix, including how to define SNMP-based   items and retrieve data from devices.</li> </ul> <p>This chapter serves as the foundation for SNMP-based monitoring in Zabbix. While we begin with the essentials such as polling, MIB usage, and SNMP item configuration this is just the start.</p> <p>Later in this book, we will build upon this knowledge by exploring Low-Level Discovery (LLD) mechanisms using SNMP.

SNMPv3 should be your go-to choice, delivering authentication and encryption to secure sensitive data. The SNMP walk item type adds another advantage collecting multiple metrics in bulk with a single request, making discovery and ongoing polling faster and more efficient.</p> <p>By combining these modern features with carefully tuned polling intervals and item counts, you can create an SNMP setup that is secure, efficient, and scalable. And with asynchronous speed, SNMPv3 security, and bulk walks at your disposal, you're ready to monitor more devices, in less time, with greater confidence.

Since this is a secure encrypted connection, it is often times used to get data from devices that do not expose it via other protocols. However, our favourite use case for SSH monitoring is to get data from devices that do have SNMP or an API, but only expose certain data through the CLI. This gives you another option in gathering information you need that the vendor might not have properly exposed.</p> <p>In our Zabbix frontend, let's navigate to <code>Monitoring</code> | <code>Hosts</code> and create a new host for SSH and Telnet monitoring.

Going with <code>Public key</code> would allow you to set: - User name: The user to login as. - Public key file: The path to the Public key we will use to login. - Private key file: The path to the Private key we will use to login. - Key passphrase: The password to decrypt the Private key.</p> <p>Keep in mind, when using SSH key authentication it is important to update you Zabbix server and/or Zabbix proxy configuration file. You can set the <code>SSHKeyLocation=</code> parameter to for example <code>SSHKeyLocation=/home/zabbix/.ssh/</code> which will be the path where the public and private keys for SSH checks (and actions) will be located.

This approach not only reduces the load on monitored systems but also simplifies the overall monitoring architecture by establishing clear parent-child relationships between metrics.</p> <p>The strategic application of LLD filters, as demonstrated in our examples, transforms raw discovery data into precisely targeted monitoring. Instead of drowning in irrelevant metrics, your Zabbix instance now focuses only on what matters to your organization's specific needs.

This script makes it possible to add a convenient option in your GUI, allowing you to place hosts in maintenance with just a few clicks. You can download the script from our GitHub repository :</p> <p>https://github.com/penmasters/trikke76-fork/blob/master/maintenance/</p> <p>The original version can be found here:</p> <p>https://github.com/Trikke76/Zabbix/tree/master/maintenance</p> <p>Download this script and place it in <code>/usr/bin/</code> </p> <pre><code>cd /usr/bin/\nsudo dnf install wget -y\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Trikke76/Zabbix/refs/heads/master/maintenance/zabbix-maintenance.py -P /usr/bin/\nchmod +x /usr/bin/zabbix-maintenance.py\n</code></pre> <p>Our Python script relies on an additional package that needs to be installed before running. Make sure you have this dependency set up on your system before executing the script.</p> <p>install python3-requests</p> <p>Red Hat <pre><code>dnf install python3-requests\n</code></pre> Ubuntu <pre><code>sudo apt install python3-requests\n</code></pre></p> Note <p>For the user you can use the user <code>Admin</code> or you can create a new user. but make sure this user has enough permissions to create a maintenance mode. It's best practice to create a dedicated user for this in production.</p> <p>Starting with Zabbix 7.2, token-based authentication is required when working with the API. Each user can create their own tokens, while the <code>Super admin</code> has management privileges over all tokens.</p> <p>To create a token for your Admin user:</p> <ul> <li>Navigate to <code>User settings</code></li> <li>Select the <code>API tokens</code> sections</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>9.1 User API</p> <p>After selecting <code>API tokens</code> from the menu, you'll land on the <code>API tokens</code> page. Look for the <code>Create API</code> token button in the top right corner and click it to begin the creation process.</p> <p></p> <p>9.2 Create API page</p> <p>A popup window will appear for creating your new API token. You'll need to provide a unique <code>Name</code> for your token. While there's an option to set an expiration date, we'll keep our token active indefinitely by leaving the time limit settings unchanged.</p> <p></p> <p>9.3 Create new API token</p> <p>A confirmation popup will display your newly created API token, showing the <code>Auth token</code> string generated by Zabbix. Be sure to copy or write down this token immediately, as it will no longer be visible once you click <code>Close</code>. If you lose this token, you'll need to delete it and create a new one. There's no way to retrieve or view the token again through the interface.</p> <p></p> <p>9.4 Added API token</p> <p>The next step is updating our script with the proper connection details. Edit the script and modify the variables to include your Zabbix server's correct URL and the token you just created. Pay attention to whether your server uses HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Be sure the URL in your script matches your actual server configuration.</p> <p>Replace variables</p> <p><pre><code>sudo vi /usr/bin/zabbix-maintenance.py\n</code></pre> <pre><code>ZABBIX_API_URL = \"https://zabbix-url.be/api_jsonrpc.php\"\nZABBIX_API_TOKEN = \"API TOKEN\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>Now that our script is properly configured, we need to set it up in the Zabbix interface. From the main Zabbix menu, navigate to <code>Alerts</code> and then select <code>Scripts</code> from the dropdown to access the scripts configuration area.</p> <p></p> <p>9.5 Scripts menu</p> <p>You should already see a few existing script  like <code>Ping</code>, <code>Traceroute</code>, .... that's normal those where created with the installation of Zabbix. Press the button <code>Create scripts</code> on the top right corner. A now form will popup where we will configure our maintenance script. Fill out the following fields:</p> <ul> <li>Name: Create maintenance no data collection</li> <li>Scope : Manual host action</li> <li>Menu path : Maintenance</li> <li>Type : Script </li> <li>Execute on : Zabbix proxy or server</li> <li>Commands : <code>/usr/bin/zabbix-maintenance.py create \"{HOST.HOST}\" {MANUALINPUT} no</code></li> </ul> <p>At the bottom we have a tab <code>Advanced configuration</code> Click on this and extra configuration options will appear.</p> <p>As you probably noticed we used in our <code>Command</code> the macro <code>{MANUALINPUT}</code> this will be used to gather information from a user prompt. This allows us to ask the user to fill in the time he wants to place the host in maintenance.</p> <ul> <li>Enable user input : yes</li> <li>Input prompt : How many minutes do you want to place the host in maintenance ?</li> <li>Input type : String (A dropdown box can also be used in case you have a list of options)</li> <li>Default string : 60 (but we can use anything this will just be the default answer)</li> <li>Input validation rule : <code>(\\d+)</code> (our regex in perl to only allow digits)</li> <li>Enable confirmation : yes</li> <li>Confirmation text : Are you sure ?</li> </ul> <p>If everything went well you should end up with a similar looking page :</p> <p></p> <p>9.6 Script form</p> Note <p>It is possible that you cannot select the Execute on <code>Zabbix server</code> and that you see a warning Global script execution on Zabbix server is disabled by server configuration. In this case, you will have to edit the Zabbix server configuration file and change the config <code>EnableGlobalScripts=0</code> to <code>EnableGlobalScripts=0</code> and restart the service.</p> <p>When your are ready press <code>Add</code> at the bottom of the form.

So before implementing anything custom, be sure that Zabbix doesn't provide it already out-of-the-box - either directly or in combination with some other Zabbix native features, such as preprocessing or dependent items. For example, you would not use it to measure CPU load, since Zabbix agent has <code>system.cpu.load[]</code> item. Or you would not use it for simply getting one line from some file because there is <code>vfs.file.contents[]</code> which you can combine with preprocessing to extract specific line.</p> <p>Configuring <code>UserParameter</code> is pretty straightforward and benefits can be enormous, depending on your abilities to correctly collect and structure the data of your interest. In the end, it is something that Zabbix agent executes in order to collect data. It can be simple one liner or some sophisticated sequence of commands. So it is highly related to one's ability to write those \"to be executed\" commands in neat and efficient manner.</p> <p>Main benefit of <code>UserParameter</code> is that logic behind data collection can be absolutely anything. You have total freedom, there is no dependency on specific technologies, programming languages or frameworks. There is basically one main requirement \u2013 Zabbix agent should be able to execute whatever you provide for it as a command and it should produce some (hopefully meaningful) output.</p> Tip <p><code>UserParameter</code> can be used not only to collect data, but also as a custom LLD (Low level discovery) rule.</p> <p>There are some other methods that allow you to collect custom data:</p> <ul> <li><code>zabbix_sender</code></li> <li>Zabbix API (via <code>history.push</code>)</li> <li><code>system.run[]</code> item</li> </ul> <p>Those are all great ways and have some clear use cases when you want to use each of them. However, <code>UserParameter</code> is probably the most common and most widely adopted way. It is kind of a perfect balance between simplicity in setting it up and flexibility it brings. For example:</p> <ul> <li>once setting <code>UserParameter</code> up you don't have to care about running it and also about checking interval. Zabbix agent will take care of running it and you'll set checking frequency in Zabbix GUI once creating item there (opposite to <code>zabbix_sender</code> case which is kind of a standalone in relation to Zabbix server, thus you have to take care of running it on your own)</li> <li>there is no need to take care of communication with Zabbix server itself or knowing your item ID (opposite to Zabbix API approach)</li> </ul>","tags":["advanced"]},{"location":"ch09-zabbix-extending/user-parameters/#creating-a-userparameter","title":"Creating a <code>UserParameter</code>","text":"<p><code>UserParameter</code> is available for any OS where Zabbix agent can be installed.

Best way to test it is to switch to this user and try to run it. For example, here we forget that one of the directories in path where our script lives is not reachable by anyone except us.

They are easy to understand and do not require maintenance, as they are a set and forget kind of encryption method.</p> <p>The basis is simple, Zabbix agent uses a pre-shared key (PSK) identity and a PSK string. We set these up both on the Zabbix agent and Zabbix server side to encrypt the communication between them. If you are using Zabbix proxies, the Zabbix server will make sure the proxies know about the pre-shared keys (do not forget to encrypt proxy communication).</p> <ul> <li>PSK identity: A non-secret UTF-8 string. </li> <li>PSK string: A secret between 128 bit (16 Bytes, 32 character hexadecimal) and 2048 bit (256 Bytes, 512 character hexadecimal) string.</li> </ul> Important <p>The combination of the PSK identity and PSK string has to be unique. There can not be two PSKs with the same identity string but different values. We have to keep this in mind when setting up the PSK identity and I usually use something that cannot be duplicate like the hostname of the host we're encrypting.</p> <p>Let's login to the CLI of a host with the Zabbix agent installed. We are going to edit the Zabbix agent 2 configuration file to allow for PSK encryption.</p> <p>Edit Zabbix agent 2 configuration file</p> <p>Linux CLI <pre><code>vim /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent2.conf\n</code></pre></p> <p>In the configuration file there are 4 parameters we need to edit. By default they aren't set, but we will set them as specified below.</p> <p>Zabbix agent 2 configuration file encryption parameters</p> <p>Linux CLI <pre><code>TLSConnect=psk\nTLSAccept=psk\n\nTLSPSKIdentity=zbx-agent-active-rocky\nTLSPSKFile=/etc/zabbix/agent.psk\n</code></pre></p> <p>I've used <code>zbx-agent-active-rocky</code> as the identity, as that is the hostname on my server and I will use unique PSK keys for each host. If you want to use a default identity/key pair you could use something like <code>agent-default-key</code> as the identity and use the same key on each host (less secure). </p> <ul> <li>TLSConnect: This parameter makes sure that when the Zabbix agent connects in active mode it will either use <code>unencrypted</code>, <code>psk</code>, or <code>cert</code> to connect.</li> <li>TLSAccept: This parameter makes sure that when the Zabbix agent is connected to in passive mode it will either use <code>unencrypted</code>, <code>psk</code>, or <code>cert</code> to allow the connection.</li> <li>TLSPSKIdentity: The plain text non-secret identity used for PSK encryption.</li> <li>TLSPSKFile: The path to the file where the secret PSK is stored.</li> </ul> <p>As you might have noticed, I have set both <code>TLSConnect</code> and <code>TLSAccept</code>. This is something recommended to always do to safeguard against configuration mistakes. Let's say you only use the Active Zabbix agent connection, but left <code>TLSConnect</code> set to <code>unencrypted</code>. If your Zabbix agent allows passive agent connections (due to configuration error, history or on purpose) an unencrypted connection will still be allowed. Recommendation, set both alway unless you have a good reason not to.</p> <p>We're not done with the configuration on the Zabbix agent side however, we still need to create the PSK.

We can check to see what the PSK looks like.</p> <p>Show agent.psk file with new pre-shared key</p> <p>Linux CLI <pre><code>cat /etc/zabbix/agent.psk\n</code></pre></p> <p>We get a string the looks like this:</p> <p>agent.psk file contents</p> <p>Linux CLI <pre><code>b1b3b66f2cff98285f3e0ee495bf44660dd6620be2f972207315e45ab030637ae0aa6f18033e86a0ea3a7fca600f793246ced7003351be13342a831ac860f74498153237d3528357a0fea9b0266d34ba18afe086187d6e1e00c6ff4d78433e4dd7e695099c3664903716a0e3a5bf017efc1354ce779715cff274b79ff5aab1d9\n</code></pre></p> <p>Do not use the above PSK as it is now of course compromised (everyone reading the book has it).

It relies on a dedicated set of specialized processes such as the pollers for active data collection, trappers for passive incoming data, and alerters for sending notifications to perform its core duties efficiently and concurrently.</p> <p>Each type of internal process reports its load via internal checks, indicating the percentage of time it spends working versus waiting. Consistently high utilization (approaching 100%) is a critical performance indicator, suggesting that the configured number of processes (Start) is insufficient to handle the current monitoring load. <p>If a process like the poller remains overloaded, it directly causes item collection delays, pushing new check requests into the queue. If the alerter is overloaded, users won't receive timely notifications about problems. Monitoring these metrics is thus the primary way to ensure data collection and alerting remain timely.</p> Example Key Description <code>zabbix[process,poller,avg,busy]</code> Average poller utilization <code>zabbix[process,trapper,avg,busy]</code> Trapper process load <code>zabbix[process,alerter,avg,busy]</code> Notification sender load <code>zabbix[process,preprocessor,avg,busy]</code> Preprocessing queue usage <p>Tip</p> <p>If process utilization exceeds 75\u201380% for a sustained period, increase the corresponding Start parameter (e.g., StartPollers, StartAlerters) in zabbix_server.conf.

If the server is functioning correctly, the total queue length <code>zabbix[queue,5m]</code> should remain low and stable.</p> <p>Zabbix categorizes queued items by their delay, providing buckets for items waiting for more than 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes (as seen in the internal metric <code>zabbix[queue,&lt;from&gt;,&lt;to&gt;]</code> and the <code>Queue overview</code> page). The presence of items in these high delay queues is an immediate sign of trouble, as it means the monitoring system is collecting stale data.</p> Example Key Description <code>zabbix[queue,0,1s]</code> The count of items waiting for processing for less than 1 second. This represents the normal, immediate flow of the system. <code>zabbix[queue,10m]</code> The count of items delayed by at least 10 minutes (the default to is infinity). This is the primary indicator of a severe backlog or performance bottleneck. <p>If the queue grows consistently, it signals that Zabbix is falling behind. The root cause is usually one of three things: either the data collection processes (pollers, etc.) are undersized, the database cannot accept data quickly enough (database write bottleneck), or the network connection between Zabbix and the database is saturated.

This cache holds the entire monitoring setup (hosts, items, triggers, etc.). Its size is governed by the primary CacheSize parameter in the zabbix_server.conf file.

A physical backup can be either consistent or non-consistent, also called \"hot\". A consistent backup can be restored as is, but a non-consistent backup has to be recovered using archived log files. Taking a  consistent backup usually has performance implications, as all writes to the  datafiles must be postponed for the duration of the backup.  A logical backup can only restore data to the point in time where the dump has been taken, while a physical backup can be recovered to any point in time using  the archived logs. For this reason, a physical backup is a more secure and and mature method of protecting the database when compared to a logical backup. However, since Zabbix does not handle financial transactions, but only observations,  alerts and similar, it is usually not a big deal, if the backups are done with dumps instead of physical backups. Zabbix relies heavily on the underlying database not only for the collected items (metrics), but also for storing the Zabbix configuration we create in the Zabbix frontend. This database should either be a MariaDB, PostgreSQL or MySQL database in Zabbix 8.0 as those are the official production supported database types.</p> <p>Since our history, trends and configuration data is all stored in this central database, taking a meaningful backup of our Zabbix environment is fairly simple. All we have to do is pick a backup method we like for our chosen database and then use that to backup the database. Giving you a backup you can easily restore 99% of your Zabbix environment with.</p> <p>Easily forgotten, there are also some important configuration files and you might even have some scripts hanging around on your filesystem that you need to backup. The configuration files could be restored manually with not too much effort, but those scripts could especially take a long time to restore. As such it is always important to also backup these additional files. We will explore both the database and file backups in this topic within the book.</p> <p>Various options exist for creating a database backup. Dumping the database content to a flat file is the easiest and simplest method. Physical backups requires more effort, usually installing a backup agent and configuring the backup software as well as configuring the database to run with  archiving of the database logs, and continous deletion of the archived logs. With regular backups of the database and the archived logs, a restore is possible  to the latest committed transaction in most databases.</p> <p>For dumping the contents of the database, various tools exists:</p> <ul> <li><code>mariadb-dump utility</code>: This is a built-in tool shipped with MariaDB, allowing you   to create reliable .sql file dumps of the MariaDB database. It creates a file with   SQL statements, allowing us to restore our database.</li> <li><code>mysqldump utility</code>: This tool allows us to do the same as mariadb-dump, but is   the official MySQL variant. Keep in mind that MariaDB and MySQL are going in   different directions with their codebase, so it is recommended to use the right   tool for your database.</li> <li><code>pg_dump utility</code>: PostgreSQL also has a built-in tool to allow us to create .sql   file dumps of our PostgreSQL database. This creates a very similar .sql file with   SQL statements, allowing us to restore our database fully.</li> <li><code>(Virtual) Machine disk snapshots</code>: There are various utilities on the market to   create (incremental) snapshots of a database server. Some examples are snapshots   built into Azure/Amazon AWS, Proxmox PBS server, Veeam, Rubrik and more.

In these cases, PostgreSQL\u2019s native upgrade tooling is often used to perform an in-place upgrade.</p> <p>This is where installing multiple PostgreSQL versions side by side becomes important.</p> <p>Tools such as pg_upgrade rely on having both the old and the new PostgreSQL binaries available at the same time. By explicitly controlling which binaries operate on a given data directory, administrators can perform a fast upgrade while preserving the existing data layout. When executed correctly, this approach dramatically reduces downtime compared to logical migrations.</p> <p>Some teams take this one step further by carefully structuring filesystem layouts or using symbolic links to ensure that data directories remain stable while binaries change around them.
