# Automating adding hosts with network discovery 

In this chapter, we'll explore the powerful automation features in Zabbix called
**network discovery**. This tools are essential
for scaling your monitoring efforts by minimizing manual configuration and
ensuring new devices and services are seamlessly integrated into your Zabbix
environment.

We'll dive into **network discovery**, which can be used to scan a network for hosts, especially in large or rapidly changing environments.
We'll cover how to set up network discovery rules that allow us to find
hosts on the network with the Zabbix server or proxy, reducing administrative overhead and ensuring
all relevant data is captured efficiently.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a thorough understanding of how to leverage
network discovery to create a more automated, scalable, and
efficient monitoring system.
