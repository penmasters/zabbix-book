# Proxies and the Web services component

Proxies are often regarded as an advanced topic in Zabbix, but in reality, they
are a fundamental part of many installations and one of the first components we
set up for numerous customers. In this chapter, we'll make proxies the third
subject we cover, encouraging you to consider them from the very beginning of
your Zabbix journey.

We'll start with a basic proxy setup, providing straightforward steps to get you
up and running quickly. Then, we'll take a deep dive into the mechanics of
proxies how they operate within the Zabbix ecosystem, their benefits, and the
critical role they play in distributing monitoring load and enhancing system
scalability.

Understanding proxies from the start can significantly improve your
architecture, especially in distributed or large scale environments. Whether
you're new to Zabbix or looking to refine your existing setup, this chapter will
offer valuable insights into why proxies should be an integral part of your
monitoring strategy from the start.

By the end, you'll not only know how to set up a basic proxy but also have a
clear understanding of their underlying workings and strategic advantages,
ensuring you make informed decisions as you scale your Zabbix installation.

Secondly, we'll explore the Web services component, which is essential for
generating scheduled reports in Zabbix. We'll discuss what it is, why you might
need it, the requirements for running it, and how to install and configure it
effectively.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of both proxies and
the Web services component, equipping you with the knowledge to enhance your
Zabbix monitoring setup effectively.
