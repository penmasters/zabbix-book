# Conclusion

With this, we conclude our journey through setting up Zabbix and configuring it
with MySQL or PostgreSQL on RHEL or SUSE-based systems or Ubuntu. We have walked through
the essential steps of preparing the environment, installing the necessary components,
and ensuring a fully functional Zabbix server. From database selection to web frontend
configuration with Nginx, each decision has been aimed at creating a robust and
efficient monitoring solution.

At this stage, your Zabbix instance is operational, providing the foundation for
advanced monitoring and alerting. In the upcoming chapters, we will delve into
fine-tuning Zabbix, optimizing performance, and exploring key features that transform
it into a powerful observability platform.

Now that your Zabbix environment is up and running, let’s take it to the next level.
